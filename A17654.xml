            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>whereupon, after I had peruſed it, and throughly conſidered thereof, his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemed to me, to be both good and ſound. For, at the tyme that Maiſter Caluin wrote this booke, it ſhould ſeeme by his preface enſuing, that there were many gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly infected with this monſtrous opinion. That the Soules of men dyed together with the bodies. Which ſoule and helliſh error, I feare, hath poſſeſſed and poyſoned at this day, the hartes and mindes of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, here at home within this land, not onely of the godleſſe, and ignoraunter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but euen of too too many of ſome of thoſe which make a great and glorious glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering outward ſhew, of being fauourers o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wherefore, ſeing this pamflet, was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But here, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth I heare ſome men ſay, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any, in ſo great light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to be of this minde: whome I feare I may with griefe of hart iuſtly aunſwere
<pb facs="tcp:19502:3"/> that there are too too many ſuch. For, if a man, throughly looke into the lyues and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of the multitude, yea, and that euen of the outward pretended profeſſors of the Goſpell (for I doe not ſee how they are to be more fitly termed) we ſhall then finde it to be ouertrue: of which deteſtable hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryſie the Lord God in the fulnes of tyme, will without all doubt, be terribly and fearefully aduenged, if it be not ſpedely, and earneſty repented of, and all peruerſe and crooked wayes eftſoones, reformed and amended. And queſtionles, ſeing Satan in thoſe dayes ſo luſtely beſtyrred him ſelfe, ſurely, he now, moſt terribly roareth, and rageth to deface the word of the Lord, (which as the Apoſtle witneſſeth) is the power of Saluation, to all thoſe that in trueth beleue it: And he in very deede the earneſtlyer, and buſilier trauelleth herein, becauſe he perceiueth that his leaſe is by many yeares, neerer at an end, then at that tyme it was, and therefore goeth about hand ouer head (as we commonly ſay) to make hauock of his Lordes enheritaunce, as vſually all wicked leaſees doe, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the expiration and full terme of their yeares.</p>
            <p>wherefore (right honorable) at the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motion of that my friend, I tooke vpon me to engliſh this Treatiſe, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit (I truſt) of all thoſe my Countreymen
<pb facs="tcp:19502:4"/> of this our Engliſh nation, which ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently reade the ſame. And for ſomuch, as I am of neceſſitie enforced to ſeeke for ayde of ſuch a Patron, as I might aſſure my ſelfe to be of ſome ſinguler towardnes of perfect wiſedome (I meane not of ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as worldlinges dreame of, but of that true wiſedome, which is the knowledge and obedience of and to the Maieſtie of the word of God) whereby, this Argument might finde ſuch one as were of power able, in knowledge wiſe, in zeale and affection willing and forward, to withſtand the aduerſaries of this peſtilent Doctrine, in which wiſedome, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth the very ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the young men, and the right vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and honor of the aged: I haue at this preſent take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bouldnes to chooſe your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip out from amongeſt the reſidue of the Nobilitie of this noble realme of England, to addreſſe this my poore trauell vnto: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring my ſelfe that you will be moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer the ſame to march vnder your enſigne, agaynſt all the enemies thereof. And therefore, if the worthynes of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter herein conteyned, and handled by Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Caluin, may ſo excuſe the vnworthynes of my ſimple ſtile in the tranſlating hereof, as that your honor vouchſafe to accept the one with the other, and beare with the one for the other, your noble curteſie ſhall the rather confirme all the true profeſſors of the

            <p>And beſides, there is no doubt, but that he which hath begonne this good worke in you, will lykewiſe performe it, vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt: ſo that, your perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce therein, will afourd you a moſt firme and ſure ground worke, for the vpholding and continuing of your noble houſe, in a proſperous and floriſhing ſucceſſe, without the which perſeueraunce, vnto the end, and in the end, there is no acceptation with the Lord of all our doings whatſoeuer: For as it is ſayd in the 18. of Ezechiell his propheſie and 26. verſe. When a righteous man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in his righteouſnes, but turneth away from it, and committeth iniquitie, he ſhall euen dye for the ſame: he ſhal euen dye in his iniquitie which he hath done.

For, as yet, I had neuer hard any ſpeach of them, ſaue onely a confuſed kinde of buzzing of a thing, ſo that if I ſhould haue had to doe with ſuch as were not yet entred into the open playnes, I muſt needes haue played the part of one beating the buſh (as we ſay) on the blinde ſide. Neuertheles, in the end it grewe afterward to another manner of matter then I thought it would haue done: For, theſe Ianglers were ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and carefull to maintayne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their faction, as that they had already drawne into their error, I know not how many thowſands of people. And in deed to ſay truly, ſo far as I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſe this miſchiefe waxeth worſe &amp; worſe. For at the firſt beginning, there were but a few that made a confuſed kinde of prattle of the ſleaping of the ſoules: and therewith they would neuer let it be vnderſtoode what they meant by this ſleape. Now, ſithence that tyme haue ſtept out theſe boucherly ſoule-ſleaers, who at the firſt blow cut their
<pb facs="tcp:19502:6"/> throates, and yet (thankes be to God) doe them no hurt at all. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I verely thinke, that the error of the firſt ſort is not to be borne withall, and beſides, that this ſecond kinde of them, is liuely to be repreſſed: For, neither of both ſortes, haue any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either of reaſon, or yet of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Howbeit, it is no eaſy matter to perſwade others thus, except, Mauger their beards (as we commonly ſay) I openly refute theſe babling Gallauntes, and ſo diſcouer their leaſings, which can no way be perceiued but by their wrytings. Now, as I heare ſay, they heare and there let flye (I know not in what ſhort ſceduls and pamfletts) their leaſings and dolteries, vnto which I could neuer as yet once come to the ſight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Onely I haue receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of mine certen aduertiſements, which he by aduenture met withall, and ſet them downe in wryting as they came to his hands, or as he could here and there get them. And although one of my excuſes, is as it were halfe taken from me by reaſon of theſe aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
<pb facs="tcp:19502:7"/> yet, remaineth the other halfe ſtill to my ſelfe. But, forſomuch as they drawe vnto their error great ſtore of people by reaſon of their troubleſome ſpeaches, and mighty prattle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ſo greatly deale, as if they had cauſed printed bookes to haue bene ſpread all the world ouer, I know not how I can be guiltles of treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the trueth of God, if in ſo great a neceſſitie I holde my peace, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the matter. And truely, becauſe I hope my trauell wil be very profitable euen to the moſt ſimple and ignoraunt, who may ſet themſelues occupied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter and Argument, I will not be a feard to render vnto all honeſt and godly men a reaſon of my fayth: And yet it may be, that it is not ſo well furniſhed with all kindes of defence, able at full to geue the attempt, to the enemy: neither yet ſo ſtrongly bulwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as to keepe them from approching thereto, neuertheles I hope, not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnarmed and defenceles. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, if the importunitie of theſe dreame ſowers, would haue geuen me
<pb facs="tcp:19502:7"/> ſome more leaſure, I would with all myne hart, haue entred into this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which can no way bring with it, ſo great gayne, as payne: conſidering eſpecially, becauſe I thinke that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the Apoſtle, might if it were at any tyme needefull, be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in this behalfe, to witt, that we ſhould be of diſcreete Iudgement. And although theſe men will not ſuffer vs to vſe the diſcretion which we gladly deſier, yet will I haue as great regard as I can, modeſtly to diſpute of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neuertheleſſe, I would (if it had ſo pleaſed the Lord our God) that ſome other meane might haue bene found, for the ſoddayne cutting of, of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe which too too much encreaſeth, leaſt it eate in farther and farther, lyke a Cancker. Although this be not the firſt tyme onely of the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For we reade, that the Arabians, were the firſt Aucthors of this error: who ſayd: that the ſoule dyed together with the body, and that they ſhould both of them riſe agayne at the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day. And within a while after,
<pb facs="tcp:19502:8"/> Iohn, Byſhop of Rome defended the ſame, which the Sorboniſtes of Paris made him recant. Now, when this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had long tyme after that, bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the Anabaptiſtes beganne late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reuiue the ſame, and blow abroad certein ſparkes thereof: which, ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling farre and wide, in the end, fell out into hoat fiery flames: which, I beſeech the Lord God to quench, euen at the firſt day with this gladſome raine which he eſpecially reſerueth for his Church. Now then, by the aſſiſtaunce of God his holy ſpirite, I entend to diſpute hereof without bitternes of minde, without tying my ſelfe to any man par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and alſo without deſier to ſcoffe and ſlaunder, ſo that no man ſhall be able in trueth to complayne, that I haue hurt him, or yet by any meanes poſſible, once offended him. Though we may in deede, at this day ſee ſome men, very hoatly geuen to reprehend, ſting and finde fault, whome if a man ſhould touch but with the typp of the finger, would by and by cry out and ſay, that we breake the vnitie and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes
<pb facs="tcp:19502:8"/> of the Church, and vtterly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late charitie and Brotherly loue. But to theſe men, this is mine aunſwere in the firſt place: That we acknowledge no vnitie but ſuch as is founded in and vpon Chriſt, neither yet allow we of any other charitie, then of that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is the bond. So that, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall poynt and beginning to preſerue charitie, is this, that our fayth remaine holy and ſound emongeſt vs. And ouer and beſides this, I ſay, that this diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may very well be decyded with out any breach of charitie, if they bring with them ſuch eares, as I determine to bring a tongue.</p>
            <p>And as for you, right worthy Syr, there are many cauſes to induce me to dedicate this my labor vnto you: But the chiefeſt is this, Becauſe emongeſt theſe troubles of vaine opinions, by which a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of fantaſticall braynes diſturbe the quiet of the Church, I ſe you moſt wiſely and ſoberly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſtedfaſt and ſound.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I peruſed this diſputation, I perceiued vpon the very point of the handling of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, certen bitter, and ſharpe kinde of wordes, which poſſibly, may grieue and offend ſome delicate and fine eares. But becauſe I know that many good and godly men haue ſuffred ſome part of this ſleape of the ſoules, to enter, and poſseſſe their harts, either by too too much lightnes of beliefe, or els for want of knowledge of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which was in deede the cauſe, why they were not vpon the ſoddaine, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armed to withſtand the ſame, I would not haue them offended, nor yet take ſo much occaſion as they mought, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with me, becauſe they fall not obſtinately, and malitiouſly herein. And therefore I minde here, purpoſely to geue warning vnto all ſuch, to the end they ſhould not conſtrue any thing that I haue ſayd, to be ſpoken as it were, to put them in any heate. But let them vnderſtand thus much, That ſo often as I boldly, and freely, ſpeake, that I direct my ſpeach to that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:19502:9"/> and obſtinate generation of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes, from whoſe ſpringhead, as I haue already ſayd, this poyſonfull water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

For, I am determined ſo to behaue my ſelfe towardes them, as that if they ſhall heareafter ſpurne agaynst me, they ſpall finde me a constant defender of the trueth, and although I be not all the greateſt clearke, yet dare I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>houldly, by the grace of almighty God promiſe this, that I will be found inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. Neither haue I but in modeſt ſort, vttered my choller agaynſt them, for to ſay truely, I ſtill ceaſe from outragious and ſpightfull wordes: and haue almoſt in euery place ſo tempered my ſtile, or vaine of wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as that it is rather an apt order of teaching, then a forcible drawing: &amp; yet is it for all that, ſuch, as may draw thoſe which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>il not wilfully be caryed away. For in deed my intent is to bring them back agayne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right way, rather then to moue and prouoke them to anger. Wherefore, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and beſeech all the Readers hereof, in the name of God the Father, and of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, to bring with them
<pb facs="tcp:19502:10"/> to the reading of this Treatiſe, a perfect and ſound iudgement, and alſo a right and pure hart, as a ſeate ready prepared for the manifest receiuing of the trueth.</p>
            <p>I know well enough what fauour the thing may haue, for the pleaſing of ſome mens eares: Howbeit, we are thus to thinke, that there is but one onely voyce of lyfe, and that in deede, proceedeth from the mouth of the Lord. Wherfore, our eares out of all doubt, ought to harken vnto that voyce, ſo often as there ariſeth any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the doctrine of ſaluation, and not to liſten to any other whatſoeuer. Now, the word of God is no new, or ſtraunge thing: but ſuch as hath bin from the beginning, is now, and ſhall be for euer.</p>
            <p>And therefore they are very groſſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, who finde fault with the newnes of the word of God, being now, after long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion, or buriall, through peruerſe vſage, and negligence brought to light, and on their ſide, in my opinion, they offend as greatly, who lyke Reedes, ſuffer themſelues to be caryed away with euery winde, yea and more then that, to be ſhaken and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the least blaſt that may be. Is this
<pb facs="tcp:19502:10"/> to learne Ieſus Chriſt, when as we will geue eare vnto all kindes of doctrine, how true ſoeuer they be, without the warrant of God his word? For, if we receiue the doctrine, as from a mortall man, ſhall not leaſings alſo as eaſely preuaile and take place with vs? And what bringeth man with himſelfe, but onely vanitie? Now, this is not to follow the example of thoſe, who after they haue once receiued the word of God, deepely ſound and ſearch the ſcriptures, to know whether it be ſo or no. This is then a good example if we would fellow it: But we receiue the word, I know not how negligently and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or rather contemptuouſly, ſo that if we haue learned but three wordes of it, we forthwith ſwell with an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wiſedome, and yet neuer burſt: thinking our ſelues by and by to be Princes, and great rich men.</p>
            <p>And vpon this imagination, we ſhall finde a mighty number cry mainely out, and keepe a great coyle, agaynſt the ignoraunce of all ages: and yet themſelues as ignoraunt as they, agaynſt whome they ſo proudely cry out. But what ſhall a man ſay, or doe to this geare? They would be taken forſooth for Chriſtians, and ſo in deede are called,
<pb facs="tcp:19502:11"/> becauſe they haue had a lick at the wikes of the lips of ſome of the principal poynts, or Articles, of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> places. And forſomuch as they thinke it a great ſhame to be ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in any thing, they will ſhameleſly aunſwere to euery matter, as if they were all oracles which come out of their mouthes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from thence doe ſpring ſo many ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, errors, and opinions, ſuch a number of offences, and hardnes of our beliefe: ſo, that by this occaſion, the Infidels proſtitute them, and blaſpheme the name, and word of God. And in the end (which is the very ground worke of all miſchiefe) whenas they obſtinately continue the maintenaunce of any thing, which hath lightly paſſed their mouthes, they fourthwith runne to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their error by the holy ſcriptures. O good &amp; mercyfull God, when they are once growen to this poynt, what is it that they will not turne vpſide downe? what is it that they will not depraue, or corrupt to make it yeld, yea forcibly wring and wreſt it, to their mindes and purpoſes? And therefore the Poet ſayd very well, that fury cauſeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and debate. Is this, I beſeech you, the way to learne, to turne ouer the leaues
<pb facs="tcp:19502:11"/> of the ſcriptures, to ſerue our fond appetits, and be ſubiect to our mindes? Was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a fooliſher thing then this? was there euer greater folly? O moſt pernicious peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: <hi>O</hi> dronklieu darnell, the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and ſure enemy to mankinde, which meaneth to ouergrowe and choake the good and true ſeede. But yet let vs be abaſhed to ſee that ſo many ſectes ſhould come from thoſe which firſt profeſſed the Goſpell, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the word out of the dark Truely this threat greatly troubleth me, where it is ſayd The kingdome of God ſhall be taken from you, and geuen to another nation, that ſhall bring fourth the fruites thereof. And here I meane to end my complaynt: becauſe my booke would be ouer great, if I ſhould make ſuch a declamation, as appertayneth to the froward dealing of theſe dayes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my brethren, let vs, after ſo many examples be admoniſhed, or at the leaſt, yet in the end, become wiſe. And let vs wholy depend vpon the mouth of God, and ſtill looke vnto his word: neither let vs add, or entermeddle any thing of our owne, to or with his wiſedome, to the end our Leauen marre not the whole lumpe, and make the
<pb facs="tcp:19502:12"/> ſalt that is in vs, vnſauery But let vs ſhew our ſelues to be ſuch obedient ſubiects to our God, as he would haue vs be: to witt, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſimple, and playne, not cleauing to our owne wiſdome &amp; very zealous to learn: yet let vs know nothing, or be willing to learne any thing, ſaue onely that which he ſhall teach vs, And beſides, let vs flee whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is ſtraunge, and not conteined in his law, as a deadly poyſon. I will meete alſo with thoſe kinde of men, who would faine finde fault with my meaning, and ſay, that I rayſe vp terrible ſtyrres, and controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, about a matter of nothing, decyding theſe quarrels with cruell diſsentions. For I am ſure there are great ſtore of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who will not ſtick thus to deale with me. And therefore I aunſwere them thus: That ſeing the word of God, is of ſet purpoſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately aſſayled: that the leaſt iotte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is by no meanes to be abidden, to be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the wall: and this is not a matter of nothing, or of ſo light regard, to ſee the light of God thus furiouſly put out, through Satans obſcuritie and darkenes. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, this cauſe is of farre greater waight, then many take it to be. But by the way,
<pb facs="tcp:19502:12"/> he that cannot away to ſee the errors and fooliſhe opinions of others, is not therefor as they enterpret it, by and by to be ſayd, that he opinatiuely diſagreeth, euen to the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of bloud. For, I reproue nothing els, but the fooliſh curioſitie of ſuch as ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe queſtions, which are nothing els, in very deede, but a tormenting and vexing of the minde. Neuertheles after they had reuiued this dounghill opinion, it was meete their raſhnes ſhould be reproued, to the end they ſhould not preuaile agaynſt the trueth. Now, I knew not whether I was able to doe it or no, yet my will was very good: &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer goodnes is in it, I haue alſo with good will deliuered it: Wherefore, if there are any others that can better deale in it, Let them in Gods name beſtow their trauell to the common benefite of their poore Brethren.

And preſently we will ſhew, how true the ſame is.</p>
            <p>Now, we will beginne at the firſt creation of man, wherein we ſhall right well perceiue, what maner of one he was made from the beginning. The holy hiſtory telleth vs, what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and councell of God was, before he created man, in making him after his owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and lykenes. Theſe words ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no way be meant of the body, wherein although a wonderfull worke of the Lord God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth aboue all the reſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19502:18"/> which he created, yet we ſe not any Image of God to ſhine in him.<note place="margin">Gene. 1.26</note> For what is he which thus ſayth? <hi>Let vs make man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our owne Image and lykenes</hi> It is euen God himſelfe who is a ſpirite, who cannot be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by any bodyly ſhape. For lyke as a bodyly image which repreſenteth vnto vs the face of a man, ought liuely to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs all his lyneaments, and proportions, that by the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiting, or engrauing, we might conceiue whatſoeuer might be ſene in him, which the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth: Euen ſo this Image of God muſt through the ſame lykenes, ſet before our ſenſes a certaine vnderſtanding of the knowledge of God. And I right well know what a number of them prattle, ſaying, that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God is lykened vnto the rule and gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which is geuen vnto man ouer the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures: becauſe that therein, man is ſomewhat lyke vnto God, who hath dominion ouer all things. Into the which error <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> him ſelfe fell, when as he erred by ouer great
<pb facs="tcp:19502:19"/> vehemency in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futing the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Anthropomorphites.</hi> But the Scripture can in no wiſe abide to be thus dallyed withall. Wherefore becauſe that no man might ordayne any ſuch Image to be in the fleſhe of man, <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſayth that the body was firſt made of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſlime of the earth, and yet for all that in ſuch ſort as that it no wayes repreſented the Image of God. For it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſayd, that lyfe was breathed into the body which was faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of the duſt of the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that euen then the Image of God beganne to ſhine firſt in man, when as he was fully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in all partes. But it may be obiected and ſayd, what? doe you thinke that this breath of lyfe is the Image of God? No ſurely, although I might very well ſay ſo, aſwell as a great many of others: and it may be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhould not ſpeake greatly amiſſe.<note place="margin">This obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth S.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19502:19"/> whence haue the ſoules of the reſt of the liuing creatures their beginning? Let the earth (ſayth God) bring forth a liuing ſoule. &amp;c. And lykewiſe, let that which is of the earth returne agayne vnto earth. But the ſoule of man is not of the earth, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouth of the Lord, and that by a ſecrett and hidd power. Howbeit I will not, I ſay, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon this, becauſe I would not haue them to ſtryue with me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: but this onely would I obtayne at their handes, that the Image of God is without the fleſhe: For els it were no great commendation to man to be made after the Image of God: which notwithſtanding is ſo greatly commended, and ſo often repeated vnto vs by the holy ſcriptures. For what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it I beſech you, to bring in God deliberating with himſelfe, and as it were ſitting in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, if he had gone about to haue made a common and ordinary thing? For as concerning all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, he onely ſayd, let them be, &amp; by and by they were made, but when he came to this
<pb facs="tcp:19502:20"/> Image, as if he had meant to ſhewe a ſinguler profe of his workemanſhipp, he called to counſayle his wiſedome and power, and was fully reſolued in himſelfe, before he once ſet hand to the ſame. Hath <hi>Moyſes</hi> then ſo curiouſly to no purpoſe, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this maner of ſpeach, which being borrowed from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe of men according to their ſlender capacityes, who are as it were very young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to ſet before vs the Lord God, whoſe greatnes and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome no creature is able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend? But hath he not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſo ſpeaking, moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly commended the Image of God, which ſhyneth in man? And he is not ſatiſfied with once ſpeaking thereof, but repeateth it oftentymes. Now let the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers or els theſe tryfelers, bring with them what doltiſh mockeries ſoeuer they will, we are ſure of this, that nothing may beare the Image of God, but that which is a ſpirite: For in very deede God is a ſpirite.

            <p>It may well be ſayd, that man knoweth the thinges which are in himſelfe, but he meaneth in one word, that part, wherein the power of the thought and vnderſtanding conſiſteth.

For we know how many tymes Chriſt him ſelfe by his owne voyce condemneth the error of the Saduces,<note place="margin">Math. 22.23.</note> a part of which error was, that there was no ſpirite: as S.

This opinion was ſo notably receiued in this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed tyme,<note place="margin">In the ſame of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the fleſh</note> that <hi>Tertullian</hi> put it euen emongeſt the common and
<pb facs="tcp:19502:24"/> chiefeſt conceites of the minde, which nature commonly taketh hold of. And although we haue already brought in many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which are able (as I think) to conuince y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they ſtraue about, to witt, that the Soule or ſpirite of man is a ſubſtance diſtinguiſhed from the body, yet that which we will add forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſhall make the ſame a great deale more certayne. For I come to that which I did ſet downe in the ſecond place, to witt, that the ſoule lyueth after that the body is dead, hauing both ſence and vnderſtanding. Now whoſoeuer thinketh that I doe heere affirme any other thing then the Immortalytie of the ſoule, is greatly deceiued. For they which confeſſe that the ſoule liueth, and therewithall take from her all her ſenſes, doe imagine a ſoule, which hath no parte at all of a ſoule, or els deuiſe a ſoule of their owne heds: conſidering that her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (without which ſhe can no way ſtand) is to moue her ſelfe, to feele,<note place="margin">In the ſame of the fleſh of Chriſt.</note> to haue ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dt &amp; (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayth)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19502:24"/> that the ſence, is the ſoule of the ſoule. Let vs therefore learne this Immortalytie of the ſoule out of the holy ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>When our Sauior Chriſt exhorteth his diſciples not to feare them which kill the body,<note place="margin">Math. 10.18. Luke. 12.5.</note> &amp; haue no power ouer the ſoule: but to feare him, who after he hath ſlayne the body, is able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſend the ſoule into hell fier: doth he not meane that the ſoule lyueth, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the dody is dead? And truely God hath very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly dealt with vs herein, that he hath not ſuffred our ſoules to be at the diſpoſition of thoſe which would ſo ſoone kill them, or at the leaſt though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, yet doe their beſt. The Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes torment, cut in peeces, burne, and hang, but it is the body onely, for God onely hath power ouer the ſoule to caſt it into hell fier. So then eyther the ſoule abideth after death, or els this muſt needes be an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth: That Tyrantes haue no power ouer the ſoule. Vnto this they au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere (as I heare) that the ſoule truely is ſlaine for the tyme, when as the body is
<pb facs="tcp:19502:25"/> dead, but that it pear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they are both reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vntill the day of Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, therefore neither of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>S. Peter lykewiſe manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declareth no leſſe, the ſoules to be and to lyue after death, when he ſayth: That Chriſt preached to the ſpirites that were in priſon, and not onely vnto the ſpirites of the faithfull, remiſſion vnto ſaluation, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnto the ſpirites of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vtter deſtruction. For thus doe I enterprete this place, which hath ſo greatly troubled many mens witts: and I hope ſo to perſwade all good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. For when he had ſpoken of the humilitie of the croſſe of of Chriſt, and he had ſhewed that all the faythfull ought to faſhion themſelues to be lyke
<pb facs="tcp:19502:26"/> vnto him, that they might not deſpayre, he forthwith ſpeaketh of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they might vnderſtand &amp; know the very end of all tribulations. For he ſayth that Ieſus Chriſt was not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome of death, but hauing ouercome it, ſhewed himſelfe triumphant. Which thing he declareth by theſe wordes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth: that Ieſus Chriſt was in very deed, dead in the fleſhe, but yet quickened in the ſpirite. And ſo alſo meaneth S. Paule, when he wryteth, that he ſuffred in the humilitye of the fleſhe, but was rayſed vp agayne by the power of the ſpirite. Now to the end the faythfull might vnderſtand that the ſelfe ſame power belongeth vnto them, he goeth on farther and ſayth that Ieſus Chriſt hath beſtowed this power vpon others, and not onely on the quicke, but alſo vpon the dead: and beſides, not onely vpon his ſeruauntes, but alſo vpon the faythles, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſers of his grace. Moreouer, let vs vnderſtand that this is a maymed kinde of ſpeach, and wanteth one of his two braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19502:26"/> of which ſort are many examples in the ſcriptures: and chiefely when many ſentences are gathered together vnder one concluſion, as here is done. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet let any man thinke it ſtraunge, that the holy Fathers are ſhut vp in pryſon, who loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption that ſhould be obtained by the ſonne of God. For becauſe they beheld a farre of, the light as it were vnder a cloude or ſhadowe, as they doe which behold ſome ſhimmering of the day euen in the twy light, and perceiue the comming of the day before the dawning: nor as yet had not the bleſſing of God reuealed vnto them, wherein they might repoſe themſelues, he calleth their hope a pryſon or dungeon. The meaning then of the Apoſtle is this: That Ieſus Chriſt preached in ſpirit vnto the ſpirites which were in pryſon: to witt, that the power of the redemption obteyned by Ieſus Chriſt, appeared, and was manifeſted vnto the ſoules of the dead. Here wanteth the other braunch which belongeth vnto the faythfull, who haue
<pb facs="tcp:19502:27"/> knowen &amp; taſted of this fruite: and ſetteth out the other brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of the faythles, who haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto themſelues this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage vnto their deſtruction. For they did ſee that there was but one redemption, from the which they were ſhut out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what thing could they els looke for, but vtter deſperation. I ſee already how theſe men murmur &amp; grudge, that I haue deuiſed this gloſe of mine owne hedd, and that they are not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto any ſuch lawes. Well I will not tye them to my lawes, but I will onely aſke them this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are not the ſoules which are ſhut vp in pryſon,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.6.</note> ſoules? It is moſt manyfeſt, which hath bin ſet downe by the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: For this cauſe alſo was the Goſpell preached vnto the dead, to the end they might be iudged as other men in the fleſhe: but yet that they ſhould lyue with God in the ſpirite. We ſee that the fleſhe is deliuered to death, and the ſpirite to be kept in life. For ſeing there is a relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene death and lyfe, it is euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the one dyeth,<note place="margin">Eccle. 12.7</note> and the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19502:27"/> other lyueth.</p>
            <p>We learne this ſame alſo of <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> who deſcribing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of man,<note place="margin">Eccle. 1.27</note> maketh a diuiſion of the ſoule farre from the body. when as he ſayth, vntill the duſt returneth into the earth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it came, and the ſpirite returneth vnto God, who gaue it. I know very well that this Argument troubleth them not much, becauſe they ſay that lyfe returneth vnto God, who is the fountayne of lyfe, and ſo by that meanes it is no more any thing. But the words themſelues crye mainely out, that there is great wrong offred them, ſo that it ſhall not be needefull to confute this iolly ſubtilty, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worthy the reading nor yet the hearing. This then is their meaning, that the ſoules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto their fountayne of lyfe in a dreame. And there is a ſaying in <hi>Eſdrars</hi> aunſwerable vnto this, I would not bring in this Author before them, but that I know they make it their Buckler. Let them now harken what their <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">4. Eſd. 7.32</note> The earth ſhall reſtore thoſe which
<pb facs="tcp:19502:28"/> ſleape in her, &amp; thoſe alſo which dwell with her in ſilence, and their ſecret places ſhall deliuer thoſe ſoules which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By the ſecret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they meane the prouidence of God, and by the ſoules, the thoughtes. This is their iolly gloſe, that the booke of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent lyfe might offer vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtes before the face of God. And thus a man may very well ſee, that no other reaſon maketh them thus to ſay, but that they haue no better to ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as if ſo be it were a ſhame for them to be ſilent. Now if it were lawfull for a man to wreſt and toſſe the Scriptures after this maner it were an eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to turne all thinges vpſyde downe. Although I haue many other things to bring in agaynſt them, yet will I bring forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here, of mine owne: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Author himſelfe may defend himſelfe from ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.<note place="margin">4, Eſd. 43.</note> For it was ſayd a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, haue not the ſoules of the righteous called for theſe things in their ſecret places? how long lyue we thus in hope? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19502:28"/> the fruite of the Ayer of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward come? what ſoules are they which thus call and hope? They muſt digg here another mine if they entend to eſcape.<note place="margin">Luke. 16.22.23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs now come to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Rich man,</hi> and of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> The one of which, after he had paſſed many griefes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of this mortall lyfe, was in the end caryed into the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fell into euerlaſting torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and payne. The one is tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the other comforted. There is a great bottomleſſe deapth betwene the ioyes of the one, and the greuous torments of the other. Are theſe dreames or fables?</p>
            <p>But becauſe they would haue ſome way to eſcape, they make a parable of this ſtory, and ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer the trueth ſpeaketh of Abraham, the rich glutton, and of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is but a fained thing. This is all the reuerence they beare vnto God and to his word. But I aſke this of them, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bring forth but one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly example out of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where, in a parable, any
<pb facs="tcp:19502:29"/> man is called by his name. I pray you tell me what is meant by theſe wordes. There was a poore man named <hi>Lazarus</hi> &amp;c. Either muſt the word of God be a falſe lye, or els this muſt needes be a very true ſtory. The auncient Doctors alſo had great regard to this: For S. Ambroſe ſayth, that it is rather a ſtory then a parable, becauſe there is a name put in. S. Gregory is of the ſame opinion. <hi>Tertulyan, Ireneus, Origen, S. Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>S. Ierome,</hi> doe take it for a hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Emongeſt whom, <hi>Tertuly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> thinketh that by the Rich man is meant <hi>Herode,</hi> and by Lazarus, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> And ſee what Ireneus ſayth: The thinge which is recyted vnto vs by the Lord of the Rich ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of Lazarus, is no fable. And Cyrill aunſwering the Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, who out of this place made it their buckler for the refuting of the diuinitie of Chriſt, refelleth not this as a parable, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it as an hiſtory. But this is a greater mockery, that for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthning of their error, the more they pretende the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19502:29"/> name of S. Auguſtine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might the better wrangle, ſay, that he yelded to the ſame opinion. I thinke they doe it for this cauſe, for that he hath ſayd in an certein place, that we muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, Ieſus Chriſt, and by the Rich man the Pharyſies: and yet his meaning is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but that this ſtory is to be tranſferred into a parable, if the perſon of Lazarus be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Ieſus Chriſt, and the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Rich man vnto the Pharyſies. This is alſo the cuſtome and manner of all ſuch men as haue once concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an opinion of any thing, to ſuffer themſelues afterward, viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to be caryed away with the ſame. For, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee they haue no ſure ground to ſtay on, there ſhall not be ſo ſmall a tittle of a letter which they will not laye faſt hold on, to wrythe and wreſt it to ſerue their owne turnes. Notwithſtanding, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end they might not ſtill groyne and grunt, S. Auguſtine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth in another place, that he receiueth it for an Hiſtory.
<pb facs="tcp:19502:30"/> Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now go &amp; ſell their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfett wares at noone day. And yet ſhall they not be able to flye any whither, but that they ſhall alwayes maſhe themſelues in theſe very ſnares. For, admit we did graunt it them to be a parable (which they ſhall neuer be able to obtaine at our hands) What other thing can they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereupon, but that there is ſome ſhewe of trueth in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paryſon? Now if theſe great Diuines know not this, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goe learne at the firſt principles of the Gramarians, and they ſhall finde that a parable is a ſimilitude taken from the truth. For when we heare that a man had two ſonnes vnto whome he diuided and lotted out their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there muſt needes be a man, ſonnes, an enheritaunce, and a diuiſion of portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer this is alwayes the nature of a parable, firſt we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of the bare matter as it is propounded, afterward we are ledd to the end of the parable, to witt, to the thing it ſelfe whereunto the parable is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. And herein let them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19502:30"/> Chriſoſtome as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. He alwayes thought this to be a parable, and yet he ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drewe out of it the truth. As when he proueth out of it, that the ſoules of the dead are in certayne places, he ſheweth how horrible hell fier is, and the deſtruction that commeth of pleaſures. And leaſt I ſhould here loſe much ſpeach, let com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon teach them, if they haue any, and they ſhall ſoone vnderſtand what the ſtrength and reaſon of a parable is.</p>
            <p>And bycauſe we would gladly ſatiſfy all men as much as in vs lyeth, we will heere ſpeake ſomewhat of the reſt of Soules which are departed from the bodyes in an aſſured fayth of the promiſes of God, and ſurely the holy ſcripture meaneth nothing els by the boſome of Abraham, but this reſt. In the firſt place we call that, reſt, which theſe waſte diuines, call ſleape. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would we refuſe this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of ſleape, were it not, that by their lying, they haue won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully corrupted, and almoſt vtterly defaced it. Moreouer,
<pb facs="tcp:19502:31"/> we vnderſtand not by reaſt, ſlouthfulnes, or ſlumber, or any ſuch other lyke dronken thing, as they attribute vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoules, but tranquility and a good aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuraunce of conſcience, which although it be alwayes ioyned with fayth, yet is it neuer ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or altogether perfect, but after death. The Church no doubt, heareth from the mouth of God,<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 32.17.</note> the bleſſinges of the faythfull, being yet but as a ſtraunger here on earth, to witt: <hi>My peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall walke in the beauty of reſt, and dwell in a peaceable habitation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſaiah. 26.12.</note>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19502:31"/> vpon them: ſo that they now looke for none other thing at the handes of God, but all goodnes,<note place="margin">Iob. 7.</note> and mercie. But <hi>becauſe that the lyfe of man is a warfare vpon earth,</hi> they which feele the ſtings of ſinne, and the dregges of the fleſhe, muſt haue trouble in this world, and be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted in God: &amp; in this ſorte they ſhall neuer be without an vnquiet, &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled minde. But when as they ſhall haue put of the fleſhe and the luſtes thereof (who as home enemies doe trouble their peace and reaſt) they ſhall in the end be at quiet and reſt in the Lord For thus ſayth the prophet:<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 57.1.</note> 
               <hi>The righteous peariſheth, and there is no man that once thinketh of him in his hart: good and godly people are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, and no man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth thereof: for the righteous is conueyed away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked.</hi> let peace come vnto him, and let him reſt in his bed which wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his wayes, doth he not call them vnto peace?

And as if God had now fulfilled in deed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which he had promiſed, that bleſſed ſeede, he looked for it, with as an aſſured fayth, as if he had handled it with his handes, &amp; had felt it with all the powers of his minde and body.<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.36</note> And ſo our Lord Ieſus Chriſt witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: <hi>that he ſaw the day and was glad of it.</hi> Thus we ſee what the peace, reſt, and ſleape of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:19502:32"/> is, ſo that this honeſt name be not defaced with the foule mouth of theſe ſleapers.

But what, O you my maiſters the ſlepers, when you heare this word to be dronken, doe you not thinke of your blockiſhnes, of your heauy hedds, and of your groſſe and carnall ſleape? For theſe griefes and diſcomodityes wayte vpon drounkennes. And you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your groſſenes doe euen thus vnderſtand it. But they which are inſtructed of God, know that by this maner of ſpeach ſleape is called peace of conſcience, which the Lord ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto his, in the houſe of peace: after the which maner alſo dronkenneſſe is called ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherewith the Lord filleth his in the houſe of abundaunce. If Abraham enioyed this peace being yet in the middeſt of the

               <hi>ſo alſo may we call it peace. For he that can geue no better nor greater thing then him ſelfe, who is the God of peace, can geue no better then it.</hi> Therefore, when we ſhall heareafter ſpeake of the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> let them not put it

This peace which leadeth the faythfull to the place of peace, doth death encreaſe &amp; aduaunce to the vttermoſt, hauing deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them from the warr of this world, and as it were cruſſhed it in peeces. And hauing theyr eyes and harts wholy fixed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, there is nothing better, or more bleſſed, whereon they may caſt theyr eyes, or ſet theyr deſyre.

               <hi>that he is made like vnto his death, vntil ſuch time as he might come vnto the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> For this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, whiche he beganne in this world by the croſſe, vntill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time that he had by his death fulfilled it.</p>
            <p>And now you my maiſters y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſleapers, examine your harts awhile, and conſider with your ſelues how Chriſt Ieſus dyed. Do you in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience think that he ſlept, when as he waked
<pb facs="tcp:19502:36"/> for your ſaluation? He ſpeaketh not thus of himſelfe:<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.26</note> 
               <hi>As the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo alſo hath he geuen to hys ſonne to haue life in himſelfe.</hi> And he that hath the power of life in himſelfe, how it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to loſe it? And I truſt they wil not ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the deity. For if it be geuen to him that hath it not, it is then geuen to his humanity, to haue life in it ſelfe, and not to his deity. For ſeing that Ieſus Chriſt is the ſonne of God and man, that which is by nature as God, the ſame is by grace as man: to the end we might al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of his fulneſſe, grace for grace, when men do heare that life is in God, what hope may they conceiue thereof, whenas they may alſo very well know, that their ſinnes do ſet a cloude betwixt God and them?</p>
            <p>But here is the onely true &amp; great comfort, that the Father hath annointed his Chriſt with the oyle of gladnes aboue all the reſt of his fellowes: That Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as man hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his Father, gyftes in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19502:36"/> to the end we might finde life in our nature. And for this cauſe, we read that the multitude glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed God after that the childe was rayſed vp agayne, forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vnto men. And this knew <hi>Cyrill</hi> right well, who agreeth with vs in the explaning of this place. Now, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath life in himſelfe, in that he is man, we doe not ſay that he is the cauſe of life to himſelfe: but onely this, that the heauenly Father, hath poured all fulnes of life in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manhood of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, whiche thing might be geuen vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by a familiar ſimilitude. The fountayne from which all men do draw water, and from which the ſmall Creekes and Armes doe runne and flow, is ſayd to haue water of it ſelfe, &amp; yet commeth not as of it ſelfe, but from the ſpring which day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feedeth it, and from the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtreames, and is ſufficient for all men to draw out of: Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo then, Ieſus Chriſt hath life in himſelfe, to wit, the fulnes of life wherewith he lyueth, and
<pb facs="tcp:19502:37"/> quickeneth his: and yet hath he it, not as of himſelfe, as he wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth in an other place, that he liueth becauſe of hys Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And whenas he had life in in himſelfe, as God, yet when he tooke vpon him the nature of man, he receiued this gift of his Father, that he might alſo haue life in that behalfe in hymſelfe. Theſe thinges do moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſure vs, that Chriſt could not be deſtroyed by death, no not as he was man. And although he was truely and naturally put to death, whereof we muſt all dye, yet held he alwayes this gift of his Father. This was a true death, and a true ſeperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body and Soule, yet the Soule neuer loſt her life, which being commended vnto his Father, could not chooſe but be ſaued. And this is the meaning of the wordes of S. Peter his ſermon, by which he affirmeth, <hi>that it was impoſſible for Ieſus Chriſt to bee holden downe with the panges of death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acte. 2.24.27.</note> 
               <hi>that the ſcripture might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled ſaying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.10</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not leaue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19502:37"/> my ſoule in graue: nor yet ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> In which prophecie, although we graunt that the ſoule is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for lyfe, Chriſt aſketh, and looketh for two thinges at his Fathers hand: that he would not leaue his lyfe to deſtruction, nor yet ſuffer him to come to corruption, which was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For his ſoule was ſuſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by an heauenly power, that it ſhould not be deſtroyed: and his body was kept whole and ſound, vntill he roſe agayne. S. Peter hath knit vp all theſe thinges in a worde, when he ſayth, that Chriſt could not be held downe by death, to witt, that he could not be ſubiect to the gouernement of death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come vnder the power of death, either yet be ouercome of death. When as S. Peter in this ſermon, let the diſputation of the ſoule alone, and followed onely the incorruption of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: He did it becauſe he would make the Iewes to ſee that they were vanquiſhed, euen by their owne teſtimony, that this propheſie appertayned nothing
<pb facs="tcp:19502:38"/> at all to Dauid, whoſe ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher was emongeſt them, and they very well knew that his body was rotted: neither could they deny the reſurrection of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ionas. 2.12</note>We haue alſo another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Immortalitye of his ſoule, when as he ordayned <hi>Ionas to be a figure of his death, in that he was three daies within the Whales belly.</hi> For ſo muſt he likewiſe be three dayes &amp; three nightes in the bowells of the earth. Now Ionas cryed vnto the Lord out of the belly of the Fiſhe, and was heard. This belly is death: <hi>his ſoule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſaued in the middeſt of death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gene. 22.10.</note> 
               <hi>ſo that he might cry vnto the Lord. Iſaack</hi> alſo, who was a figure of the Lord, and being ſaued from death,<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.17 19.</note> 
               <hi>was deliuered vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> openeth vnto vs, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, the trueth in a figure, by the manner of the riſing agayne. For after he was layd vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Aultar, as an oblation and ſacrifice prepared for the purpoſe, and bound vpon it, he was ſoone after vnbou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lord;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19502:38"/> and the Ramme that was tyed by the hornes in the buſhe, was layd in Iſaack his place.</p>
            <p>What is now meant by this that Iſaack was not put to death, but becauſe that the ſonne of God hath made the ſoule which is proper to man, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall? And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ramme which is a beaſt without reaſon, and that was layd in his roome, is the body. And in that Iſaack was bound, the ſame repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſoule, which maketh an open ſhewe of one dying in the death of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſheweth it alſo dayly in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon death of men, wherein all thinges in the opinion of men doe peariſhe: and yet for all that the ſoule of Chriſt was loſed out of bonds, and ſo ſhall ours alſo be loſed, before they come to peariſhe. Come off now, ſome of you my maiſters the ſleapers which are voyd of all ſhame, and bragge that the death of the our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was but a dreame: or els let him take part with that deuiliſhe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Appollinaris.</p>

Moreouer, this doth not onely comfort vs, that the ſonne of God our head is not periſhed in the ſhadow of death, but his reſurrection alſo doth aſſure vs, that he is apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be <hi>Lord ouer death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.3.</note>

For if Chriſt hath liued in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he is the ſelfe and ſame which dyeth in them, If the lyfe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt be ours, he then which would haue our lyfe to end by death, violently plucketh the ſonne of God from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious right hand of his father,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19502:39"/> &amp; putteth him to a ſecond death. But if it be poſſible for him to dye, then vndoubtedly muſt we dye: But if his lyfe hath no end, ſurely our ſoules which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into him ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy no death.

            <p>This is an inuincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agaynſt them: that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer keepeth the word of God, ſhall neuer ſee death. And this alone might be ſufficient for Chriſtians, throughly to arme their fayth agaynſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peruerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of theſe ſleapers. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue this, and we looke for it. But as for theſe men, this is it that they muſt looke for, euen to ſleape a ſound ſleape, vntill ſuch time as they be wakened by the ſound of the trumpet, which ſhall ſodainly come vpon theſe ſleapers, as a theefe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night.</p>
            <p>And if God be the lyfe of euery faythfull ſoule, as the ſoule is the lyfe of the body, what is the meaning, that the ſoule, all the while it is in the body, cauſeth it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19502:41"/> to moue, and is neuer ſo idle, nor her ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth ſo weakened, but that ſhe doth her duety ſome maner of way, and ſhall God leaue his buſines vndone, as if he were wery of working? If there be ſo great power in the ſoule, as to ſupport, moue, and dryue on, this maſſe of earth, how great in reſpect ſhall the power of God be in the ſoule, which by nature is liuely, and very apt and ready, to ſtyrre and moue it? And yet there are ſome which dare ſay, that the ſoule vaniſheth away: and others, that after it is ſeperated from the body, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it vſeth not her power and ſtrength. How then, will they aunſwere vnto the pſalme of Dauid, where he deſcribeth the beginning, middeſt and end of the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed.

            <p>The very ſelfe ſame thing doth S.

Cor. 5.6 7.</note> Heare what he ſayth, <hi>Surely we know that if our earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly houſe of this tabernacle be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, we haue a building with God, an euerlaſting habitation in heauen, which is not made with man his hand.</hi> And therefore we groane, deſiring to be cloathed with our heauenly manſion, that we might be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cloathed &amp; not naked. And in very deede, we that are in this tabernacle, do groane being burthened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we deſire not to be vnclad but to be cladde, to the end that this mortality might be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of life. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherefore we are alwayes of good cheare, and in good hope and do know that ſo long as we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord (for we walke by fayth, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the outward ſhewe) neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, we are of good comfort,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19502:42"/> and had a great deale rather, to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</p>
            <p>Here they finde a ſtarting hole, and ſay, that the wordes of the Apoſtle are to be referred to the day of iudgement, wherein we ſhalbe cladde, and wherein mortallyty ſhall be ſwallowed vp of life. Wherfore the Apoſtle (ſay they) concludeth thus, that we muſt all appeare before the iudgement ſeate of the ſonne of God. But wherefore referre they this cloathing rather vnto the body, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the bleſſings which are plentifully beſtowed vpon vs after death? who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take this word, life, for reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle is eaſy and playne: to witte, we deſire to be deliuered out of this priſon of the body, but not to the end to wander vncertaynely without houſeroome.</p>
            <p>For there is a farre better houſe, and a more bleſſed dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which the Lord hath made ready for vs, alwayes prouided that he findeth vs clad, and not naked:<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.10</note> For <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is our

Although our outward man, ſayth he, be corrupted, yet is the inward man, renued from day to day. But that the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this concluſion, to appeare before the iudgement ſeat of the ſonne of God, bindeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more ſtraightly: where he had before ſaid: that whether we be preſent or abſent, we earneſtly ſtriue both at home and abroad to doe the thing that might beſt pleaſe him. Seing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at home, is meant the body, what is ſignified by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad? To the end then that we put nothing to, the wordes them ſelues without any expoſitor ſay thus much, that we doe our beſt to pleaſe the Lord, both
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19502:43"/> within the body and alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body: and beſides, that we ſhall feele the preſence of the Lord, whenas we ſhalbe ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this body. Then ſhall we no more walke by fayth, but in open ſight, becauſe that this maſſe of earth, wherewith we be oppreſſed, ſeperateth vs very farre of from our God.</p>
            <p>But theſe ſleapers babble cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, and ſay, we ſhall be a great deale farther of from God by death, then whiles we are here in this life. For of whom is this written:<note place="margin">Pſal.</note> 
               <hi>They ſhall walke, O Lord, in the light of thy countenaunce.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>The ſpirite it ſelfe witneſſeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſpirite,</hi>

They take away from them the light of Goddes countenaunce, and the teſtimony of the Spirit. So that if this be true, then are we bleſſeder now, then when we be dead. For although we liue now vnder the Elementes of this world, yet notwithſtanding our dwelling and abyding place is in heauen, according to the
<pb facs="tcp:19502:44"/> ſaying of Paule.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> 
               <hi>But when that Lethergy and forgetfulnes of all thinges, ſhall by death take away the ſoules, they then loſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſweetnes they haue of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall taſte.</hi> Howbeit the holy Scriptures do teach vs a great deale better.<note place="margin">Wiſe. 9,</note>

            </p>
            <p>Now then, if the body be the priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſoule, and the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habitation a manacle to bind it ſure: What ſhal become of the ſoule when it is deliuered out of this priſon and loſed from theſe bands? Is ſhe not then ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and (as a man would ſay) at her owne choyſe? In ſo much that it may well be ſayd, that looke how much ſhe decreaſeth the body, ſo much encreaſeth ſhe her ſelf. Will they, nill they, this is out of all doubt, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue caſt of this burthen of the body, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fight, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſpirit, &amp; the fleſh, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fleſh and the ſpirite, is at an end. And beſides, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiyng of the fleſh, is the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19502:44"/> of the ſpirite. Therefore whenas the ſoule hath voyded theſe excrementes ſhe is then in deede ſpirituall: and yeldeth her obedience vnto the will of God, neither feeleth ſhee the tyranny of the fleſh reſiſting her, but repoſeth her ſelfe in this quietnes, thinking vpon none other thing, but vpon God.</p>
            <p>And thus forſooth may a man well ſay that ſhe ſleapeth, when as ſhe is able to rayſe vp her ſelf without being preſſed down with any wayght? and that ſhe ſlombreth, whenas ſhe is able to vnderſtand many thinges both by feeling, and thinking, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let?

We acknowledge god to be as it were borne in his choſen, and ſtill to grow vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day to day,<note place="margin">Pro. 4.18.</note> which thing Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon teacheth vs when he ſayth <hi>The way of the righteous ſhineth as the light, and ſhineth more

            </p>
            <p>And S.

For how enterpret they this their going on? Doe they thinke the ſoules go forward in perfection, whenas they grow fat with ſleepe: that they might be offered fayre and fat before the face of God, whenas he ſhall ſit in iudgement?</p>
            <p>Surely, if they had but one grayne of wiſedome, they would not thus groſſely Iumble of the ſoule: But looke how farre the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19502:45"/> heauen is diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, ſo farre ſeperate they the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſoule from the earthly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.<note place="margin">Phil. 23.</note> When S.

But this was namely his deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was fully aſſured that he had another manſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a houſe not made with mans hande, whenas the earthly houſe, and Tabernacle of his habitation ſhould be deſtroyed? Is not this to a very good purpoſe?

But they ſay, that theſe thinges ſhall then onely come in very deede to paſſe, whenas the dead ſhall at the laſt day be rayſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to life: conſidering that
<pb facs="tcp:19502:46"/> theſe are the wordes, haue you not read that which hath bene written of the reſurrection of the dead? But yet haue they not wound themſelues out by thys meane. For when Chriſt had to do with the Saduces, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed not onely the reſurrection, but alſo the immortality of the ſoules: he confuteth theſe two errors, with this onely ſaying. For if God be the God of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and not of the dead, and Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, were out of the worlde, when God ſpake vnto Moyſes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was their God: it muſt needes follow that they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued another life.</p>

That Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob do liue.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.8.</note> Hereunto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth that ſaying of S.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19502:46"/> died Chriſt, and roſe agayne, that he might be Lord ouer the quicke and the dead.</hi> Can we ſet vpp any thing more fyrmelye whereon to ſettle and eſtabliſhe our fayth, then to heare that the ſonne of God is Lord ouer the dead? For he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be Lord but ouer ſome that are, ſeying that there muſt be ſome ſubiectes, where there is a gouernement.</p>
            <p>We ſee alſo the ſoules of the Martirs whiche are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, yelde a teſtimony herof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and his Angels,<note place="margin">Apoc. 6.10</note> who cry with a loud voyce vnder the Aultar, <hi>howe long Lord will it be before thou take vengeance vpon the inhabitants of the earth, for our bloud?</hi> vnto whom were geuen white garmentes, and was ſayd vnto them, that they ſhould reſt yet a little while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, vntill ſuche time as their fellowe ſeruauntes, and their brethren (which ſhould be ſlaine as they were) were accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.

And that they might feele with the hand their darkenes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge euen by the eyeſight their ignoraunce, if in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Ieſus Chriſt looked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of Iudgement, it ought not to haue bene ſayd to day, but in the world to come. As when Iſaiah went about to ſhew the miſery of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he calleth Ieſus Chriſt, the father of the world to come. Now ſeing the Apoſtle hath ſayd, <hi>to morrow, and to day, and for euer:</hi> Whereas we ſay, it hath bene, is, and ſhall be (which three tymes declare vnto vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie) what other thing els goe they about by their cunning
<pb facs="tcp:19502:50"/> ſubtilties, but euen to corrupt and peruert the ſence of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle?<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 30.33.</note> wee may learne out of the prophet Iſaiah, that the nature of this firſt word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth an euerlaſting tyme: who ſayth, <hi>that hell fier is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the wicked from yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:</hi> conſidering that we know by the wordes of Chriſt, that fier is prepared for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deuill &amp; his Angels from the beginning.</p>
            <p>They then which are of an vpright and ſound iugement, do here right well ſee, that there is nothing left for them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, by ſo open a trueth. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, they yet moyle and ſay, that paradiſe was for that day ſo promiſed to the theefe, as death was denounced vnto our firſt parentes, the ſame day that they taſted of the tree of knowledge, both of good and euil. But let it be that we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, yet for all that we will draw this from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt their willes, that the theefe was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day deliuered out of the miſery, whereunto Adam fell, wherin he tranſgreſſed the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that was geuen
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19502:50"/> him: and ſo euerlaſting lyfe was reſtored to the theefe. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, when as I ſhall hereafter ſpeake of death, I will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare, as I thinke, after what ſort our firſt parents dyed the ſame day, in which they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraunged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from God.</p>
            <p>And now muſt I turne my talke to thoſe, who remembring the promiſes of God, doe reſt in them with a quiet conſcience. And therefore, my brethren, let not this fayth be ſhaken of from you, no not although hell gates ſhould lift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vp agaynſt you, ſeing you haue God for your pledge. who can not deny his trueth. For his ſpeach is not darke, which he deliuereth vnto his church, being yet but a ſtraunger here below in this world, when he ſayth:<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 60.19.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no more ſunne to ſhine by day, neither ſhall the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Moone ſhine to thee: For the Lord ſhall be thine euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting light, and thy God thy glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that (as they are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily wonted) if they will ſtretch this vnto the laſt reſurrection,
<pb facs="tcp:19502:51"/> it ſhall be an eaſy matter for vs to refell their vanitye, by euery word of the chapiter: ſeing that the Lord hath now promiſed his Chriſt, and that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall be now adopted, and called vnto Fayth. Let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes call to minde that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the ſpirite of God hath taught vs by the mouth of Dauid:<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.12 13.14.</note> 
               <hi>The luſt ſhall floriſhe as the Date tree, and ſhall be multiplyed as the Cedars in Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. For they that are planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe in the Courte of our God. And in their age ſhall bring forth fruite, and be freſhe and in good caſe.</hi> Neither maruell you at this, becauſe it ſeemeth that the powers of nature doe fayle, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you heare that age ſhall be green budding and fruitefull.</p>

               <hi>as the youth of an Eagle.</hi> Remitt all the reſt vnto the Lord: <hi>Who looketh vnto our

               <hi>our God is the God of deliueraunce: and the iſſue of death is from the Lord God.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt hath vnto vs, this goodnes of the Father: when as he hath ſayd: <hi>O Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 17.24.</note> 
               <hi>thoſe whome thou haſt geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, I will that where I am, that they be alſo there: to the end they might ſee the brightnes which thou haſt geuen me,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs then hold this fayth which is grounded vpon all the prophecies, vpon the trueth of the Goſpell, and vpon Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe: to witt, that the ſpirite is the Image of God, vnto whoſe lykenes, it hath ſtrength and vnderſtanding, and is euerlaſting: and ſo long as it is in the body, it ſheweth the powers: and when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered out of this priſon, it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from thence vnto God, the feeling of whome, in the meane while, it enioyeth, whiles it reſteth in the hope of the bleſſed
<pb facs="tcp:19502:52"/> reſurrection: and this reaſt is to it a paradiſe.</p>
            <p>But as for the ſpirite of the reprobate, whiles it looketh for the terrible iudgement vpon it ſelfe, it is tormented with this looking for, which the Apoſtle therefore hath called fearefull. And to make any father ſearch, is to plunge it ſelfe ouer head &amp; eares in the bottomles depth of the ſecrets of God: conſidering that it is ynough to learne that which the holy ghoſt, who as a a very good Schoolemaiſter, is contented to teach it: who ſayth thus, harken vnto me, and thy ſoule ſhall lyue. How wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in reſpect of the vayne arrogancy of theſe men? The ſoules of the iuſt are in the handes of God, and the torment of death ſhall not touch them. They ſeeme to the eyes of the fooliſhe to be dead, but they are in peace &amp;c. This is the end of our wiſedome, which as it is ſober and ſubiect vnto God, euen ſo alſo knoweth it very well that they which labor to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, doe fall full lowe.</p>
            <p>Let vs now pull of thoſe clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19502:52"/> and ragges,, wherein they haue ſwadled vp theſe drowſy and ſleapy ſoules: and mingle and lickour the Poppy, which they haue made them to ſoupe, to lull them a ſleepe. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about with them certein pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſcripture, which as they thinke doe fauoure this ſleape. and ſoone after, as if this ſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines were clearely proued, they thunder them agaynſt thoſe, which forthwith will not yelde vnto their error. Firſt of all, they ſett downe, that God hath placed none other ſoule in man, but ſuch as is common to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſtes. For the ſcripture attributeth to al equaly, a liuing ſoule: as when it is ſayd:<note place="margin">Gene. 1.</note> 
               <hi>God created the great whales, &amp; euery liuing ſoule,</hi> alſo, <hi>there wet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gene. 7.</note> 
               <hi>of all fleſh which had any lyfe in it, by couples, into the Arke of Noah:</hi> And ſuch other lyke places. And although the holy ſcriptures had neuer made mention hereof, yet are we clearely admoniſhed by S. Paule, that this liuing ſoule differeth nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this preſent lyfe, whereby the body receiueth ſtrength and force.
<pb facs="tcp:19502:53"/> Se what he ſayth: <hi>That which is ſowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.42.43.44.45.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall ryſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne in incorruption: that which is ſowen in weakenes, ſhall ryſe agayne in ſtrength: That which is ſowne in a fleſhely body, ſhall riſe againe a ſpiritual body:</hi> for as it is written: <hi>The firſt man Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made a lyuing ſoule: and the laſt Adam, a quickening ſpirite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I confeſſe in deede, that the liuing ſoule is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed vnto beaſts alone: be cauſe they alſo liue: For their lyfe is another manner of lyfe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfe of men. The ſoule that liueth in man, maketh him to haue ſence, wiſedome, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and vnderſtanding, and the ſoule that liueth in beaſtes, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them onely mouing and feeling. Seing then it is ſo that there is reaſon, vnderſtanding, and will in the ſoule of man, which vertues are not tyed to the body: it is no maruell if it ſubſiſt without a body, and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth not lyke the ſoule of the beaſtes, whoſe ſoules haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a bodely feeling. For which cauſe, Paule was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heathen Poet,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19502:53"/> to call vs <hi>the generation of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore then let them now as they liſt, communicate vnto a lyuing ſoule with man:<note place="margin">Actes 17.28.29.</note> ſeing that as touching the body, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, lyfe is all one to men, and beaſtes: yet can they not hereupon make vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues a degree. to confound the ſoule of man with the beaſts. neither yet muſt they thruſt that ſaying of S. Paule vpon vs, which is rather with vs, then againſt vs. The firſt man Adam was made a liuing ſoule, and the laſt Adam a quickening ſpirite. For this aunſwere was obiected to them which could not be perſwaded of the reſurrection. For looke vpon the obiection which they made, how ſhall the dead ryſe agayne? In what body ſhall they come? The holy Apoſtle to meete with this obiection, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his Argument thus.</p>
            <p>If we learne by experience, that the ſeede which lyueth, groweth, and bringeth fruite, was firſt dead, why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body which was dead, ryſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne as well as the ſeede? And if the bare and dry corne, bring
<pb facs="tcp:19502:54"/> forth greater plenty of fruite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is dead, and that by a wonderfull power which God hath put into it: Why then may not the body, by the ſelfe ſame heauenly power, be rayſed vp agayne in a farre better maner, then wherein it dyed? And to the end thou mighteſt not ſtill maruell: how is it poſſible, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould lyue, without he were faſhioned into a liuing ſoule? Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, although this ſoule moueth, and vpholdeth the waite of the body for a tyme, yet maketh it not Immortall, or inccorruptible. And whiles alſo that it putteth forth her ſtrength, yet is ſhe not able as of her ſelfe to doe it, without the helpe, of drinke, meate, and ſleape, which are tokens of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: neither maketh it the body to abide in a firme &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant condition, but that it is enclyned aſſoone to one thing, as to another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But when the ſonne of God ſhall take vs with himſelfe into glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertullian ſo ſayth and S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. alſo in his 3. Epiſt. to Fortunatus.</note> 
               <hi>it ſhall not be onely a body with a ſoule, or quickened with a ſoule, but a ſpirituall body, &amp; ſuch
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19502:54"/> a one as our minde ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not conceiue nor our toung expreſſe.</hi> We ſee then that we ſhall be none other thing in the generall reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but yet much otherwiſe, if by your leaue I may ſo ſay. And theſe thinges are ſpoken of the body, wherunto the ſoule admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth life vnder the elements of this world. But when the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of this world ſhall paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the participation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God ſhall lift it vp aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Hereby we ſee what the true and naturall ſence of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is. And S. Auguſtine ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe deceiued (euen as theſe men now are) in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this text, acknowledged afterward his fault, &amp; corrected it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt his retractatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; a great deale more manifeſtly in other places.<note place="margin">Chap.</note> And here I thinke it good to ſet downe ſome part of his wordes. <hi>It is very true</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that the ſoule liueth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a carnal or ſpirituall body, and yet notwithſtanding it liueth not nor is not quickened vntil ſuch time as it hath caſt off the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But in the ſpirituall body, when it is made a quickening
<pb facs="tcp:19502:55"/> ſpirite, perfectly cleauing vnto the Lord, it is ſo quickened, as that it cauſeth the ſpirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to conſume al corruption, and not to feare any ſeparation.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, albeit I graunt vnto them all thinges concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a liuing ſoule (vpon which title, as I haue before ſayd, I ſtand not) yet that ſeat of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God remayneth whole and ſound, be it that they terme it by the name of ſoule or ſpirit, or by ſome other title. Neither is it a harder matter to refell that ſaying which they bring out of the 37. Chapiter of Ezechiell, where the Prophet deſcribing the order of the reſurrection, calleth the ſpirite from the foure windes, that it might blowe life into the dry boanes. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they verily think it a very good conſequent that the ſoule of man is none other thing, but a mouing power without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, which power vaniſheth away in death, but is receiued agayne in the generall reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>As if it were not likewiſe lawfull for me to inferre after
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19502:55"/> the ſame manner: to witt, that the ſpirite of God is a winde, or vaniſhing motion: ſeing that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiell in the firſt viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nameth winde or breath, in ſtead of the eternall ſpirite of God. But it ſhall be an eaſye matter for any man without he be too too bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, to reſolue this doubt, which theſe Gallauntes can neither marke nor perceiue, as learned and ſharpewitted as they are. For in both theſe places hath bene ſet downe the very ſame thing which the prophets very often haue ſet down, who figure out ſpirituall thinges, that are beyond mans reach and reaſon, by corporall and viſible ſignes.</p>
            <p>And therefore Ezechiell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended liuely to ſet before our eyes, as by a viſion liuely pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, aſwell the ſpirit of God, as alſo the ſpirites of men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame was contrary to the ſpirituall nature, he hath borrowed a ſimilitude from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thinges, which was as it were an Image or paterne thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſecond obiection whiche they make, is this, for although
<pb facs="tcp:19502:56"/> (ſay they) the ſoule was endued with immortallity, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding becauſe it ſinned, it hath through that ſinne loſt her immortality. And this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ordayned for ſinne, and denounced to our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> where it is ſayd, <hi>You ſhall dye the death.</hi> And S. Paule ſayth,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
               <hi>That death is the reward of ſinne.</hi> The prophet alſo cryeth out and ſayth,<note place="margin">Eze. 18.</note> 
               <hi>That the Soule which ſinneth ſhall dye.</hi> And theſe and ſuch other like places theſe drowſy ſleapers alleadge for that purpoſe. But in the firſt place I aſke them, was not the Deuill alſo payd with the ſame reward for ſinne?</p>
            <p>And yet for all that he is not ſo dead, but that he waketh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, compaſſing here and there, ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, ſtill buſiyng himſelfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the children of vnbelief. Moreouer, I aſke them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this death ſhall haue an end or not? If there be no end thereof (as in deede they muſt needes ſo confeſſe) theſe then, howſoeuer they are dead, ſhall feele notwithſtanding euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19502:56"/> hell fire, and the worme whiche neuer dyeth. Theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges therefore playnely ſhew vs, that although the ſoule be dead, yet it is immortall, whiche wee graunt them, and ſay that it fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth both good and euil: and that this death is an other manner of thing then that whiche they would haue, to witt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould turne to nothing.</p>
            <p>Neither haue the ſcriptures forgotten this, and that they ſhould haue found, if they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed their minde, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their wit vnto them, rather then aroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, and after a proud maner, to ſtand to that whiche their drunken ſleapy brayn hath told them. For when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth this ſentence agaynſt a ſinneful man and ſayth, thou art duſt, and into duſt ſhalt returne, to wit, ſayth he any other thing, but that that which is taken &amp; framed out of the earth, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the earth? And what becommeth then I beſeech you of the ſoule? Goeth it into the graue, to become rotten &amp; ſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? But we will handle theſe thinges hereafter a little more
<pb facs="tcp:19502:57"/> playnely, Why doe they then goe thus about the buſhe? we haue already heard that that which is of the earth, muſt goe agayne to the earth. Nowe is there any reaſon that we ſhould plunge the ſoule of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the earth? It is not ſayd that man ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the earth: But the thing which is duſt, ſhall return into duſt.</p>
            <p>And the thing that was made of the ſlime of the earth, is thys duſt. It is that forſooth that ſhall returne into duſt, and not the ſoule, which God gaue vnto man, as a thing taken from els where, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the earth. After this ſort we read in the booke of Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. 10.9.12.</note> 
               <hi>Remember O Lord, that thou haſt made me as the clay, and wilt thou turne me into duſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne?</hi> He ſpeaketh there of the Body: and a litle after he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the ſoule and ſayth, thou haſt geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me life and grace, and thy viſytation hath preſerued my ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And therfore this life ſhall not turne into duſt. For the death of the ſoule is farre otherwiſe, to wit, Gods dreadfull iudgement,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19502:57"/> the burden whereof the poore ſoule is no way able to beare, but muſt be vtterly confounded, and deſtroyed: as by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we are taught, &amp; as they whom God hath liuely touched, haue by experience moſt feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully felt. And to the end we might beginne at Adam, who firſt obtayned this gentle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, let vs ſomewhat conſider what hart he had, or to ſpeake more properly, what was in him at all, whenas he heard this terrible voyce, Adam, where art thou?</p>
            <p>This is a thing eaſelier thought of, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpoken. Although in very deed a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not think of it, except he eftſoonnes feeleth the ſame. And like as the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyneſſe and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of God can not in wordes be expreſſed: ſo alſo can not the terriblenes of his wrath be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, how greuous it is to thoſe, vpon whome it lighteth. For they very wel ſee the anger of God, and becauſe they would auoyde it, they are ready euen to plounge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ouer head and eares in a thouſand bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:19502:58"/> depthes: and yet are no way able to eſcape it. And who is he that will not graunt this to be a death in deede? Agayne I ſay, that a few wordes will ſerue them, who haue bene ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the hoate yron of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>And therfore let them which haue not had experience thereof, heare what the ſcriptures ſay, whenas it is ſayd,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Our God is a conſuming fier, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in iudgement, killeth.</hi> And ſuch one knew they him to bee, which ſayde,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Let not the Lorde ſpeake vnto vs, for feare we dye.</hi> Wilt thou then knowe what the death of the ſoule is? It is euen this, whenas it is without God, and that he forſaketh it, &amp; leaueth it vnto her ſelf. For ſince God is the light thereof, ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her life, whenas ſhe loſeth his preſence.</p>
            <p>And to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end we might ſhewe that by particularityes, whiche haue bene ſayd in generall: ſince it is ſo that there is no light without God, which lighteneth our night: it is moſt certayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſoule being buried in her
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19502:58"/> darckeneſſes, muſt needes be blinde. And then is ſhe domb, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe cannot confeſſe that vnto ſaluation, which ſhe beleued to righteouſneſſe. Deafe alſo ſhe is becauſe ſhe heareth not this liue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly voyce. Lame likewiſe ſhe is, and that which is worſſe, ſhe is not able to ſtand vpright, when as ſhee hath not to whome ſhee may ſay, thou haſt held me by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand, and guided me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy will: and finallye ſhe doth nothing wherein is life.</p>
            <p>For, heare what the Prophet ſayth,<note place="margin">Baruc. 3.14</note> whenas he will ſhew that the ſpring and fountayne of lyfe wholy reſteth in God: <hi>Learne where is wiſedome, where is ſtrength, where is vnderſtanding: that thou mayſt alſo knowe from whence commeth long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce, &amp; life, and where the light of the eyes, and peace is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What wouldeſt thou els more deſire to come vnto death? And to the end we ſhoulde not here ſtay in this godly way, let vs conſider with our ſelues what life it is that Ieſus Chriſt hath brought vs, and it will put vs in minde with what kinde of
<pb facs="tcp:19502:59"/> death he hath redeemed vs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note>S. Paule teacheth vs both the one and the other. For thus he ſayth, <hi>Awake thou which ſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and ariſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, &amp; Chriſt will enlighten thee.</hi> He ſpeaketh in this place vnto duſt, but yet vnto ſuch as being wrapped vp in their ſinnes, cary with them both hell and death. And in an other place he ſayth,<note place="margin">Colo. 2.</note> 
               <hi>And you when you were deade through ſinne he hath quickened you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt, forgeuing you all your ſinnes.</hi> And like as according to the ſaying of S. Paule,<note place="margin">Rom.</note> 
               <hi>we dye vnto ſinne when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as luſt is quenched in vs: Euen ſo dye we vnto God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect our ſelues vnto our luſt which liueth in vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſpeake all in a word, in liuing we dye, (which thing S. Paul ſpeaketh of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> widdow which liueth in pleaſures) to wit,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 5.</note> 
               <hi>we are immortal vnto death.</hi> For although the ſoule keepeth her vnderſtanding, yet is a gilty conſcience as it were a verye blockiſh and vnfeeling vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>Nowe therefore, whatſoeuer
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19502:59"/> this death of the ſoule was, yet for all that it is farre of that the death which Chriſt dyed for vs, is ſuch one. For he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by his death, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the prophets haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed of his victory agaynſt death. For thus haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſayd,<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 25.</note> 
               <hi>he will deſtroy death for euer.</hi> It is likewiſe ſayd, <hi>I wil be thy death, O death, &amp; hel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oſeah. 13.</note> 
               <hi>I will be thy ſting.</hi> Alſo,<note place="margin">Hebr. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Death ſhal go before his face.</hi> The Apoſtles likewiſe declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done: for thus it is ſayde: <hi>he hath ouercome death:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. Rom. 5.</note> 
               <hi>But hath enlightened life by the Goſpell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of one, death raigned through one, much more ſhall they which receiue the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of grace, and of the gifte of righteouſneſſe, raigne in life through one, that is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Let them now abide and withſtand theſe lightenigs if they can. For ſince they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> death came by Adam, (which we alſo confeſſe, but not in ſuch ſort as they imagine, but as we haue before ſaid, whereinto the ſoule fell) we on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary part ſay that lyfe came by Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:19502:60"/> which they are neuer able to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye: ſo that the poynt of the whole controuerſy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the compariſon of Adam, and of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore they muſt firſt of all reconcile this with that ſaying of S. Paule, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was onely loſt by Adam, hath bene alſo reſtored by Ieſus Chriſt: But looke, howe farre the power of grace hath ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſinne: euen ſo, of a more farre paſſing greater power hath Ie-Chriſt bene in making reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Adam was in the loſſe. For he playnely teacheth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift is farre greater then the ſinne, although not vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, yet moſt plentifully vpon thoſe, vpon whom it aboundeth. And nowe let them aunſwere if they will, that it aboundeth, not becauſe it hath geuen life more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, but becauſe it hath blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out many ſinnes, ſeing the onely ſinne of Adam is it, which hath brought vs to deſtruction. And this is the thing which I demaund.</p>
            <p>Moreouer ſeing he teacheth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19502:60"/> in another place that ſinne is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſting of death, what death is it that can ſting vs, ſince his ſting is rebated, yea altogether conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? And ſo, he handleth none other thing in many Chapiters of the Epiſtle to the Rom. But playnely declareth that <hi>ſinne is wholy aboliſhed, becauſe it hath no longer dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore if the lawe hath power ouer ſinne,</hi> what other thing then do our ſleapers who kill thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> liue in Ieſus Chriſt, but draw them into the curſſe of the law, which is cleane dead? And therefore the Apoſtle boldly ſayth, <hi>that there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them that are in Ieſus Chriſt, who walke not after the fleſh but after the ſpirite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely they pronounce a fearefull ſentence agaynſt thoſe whom S. Paule freely acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of condemnation, whenas they ſay, ye ſhall dye the death. What is then become of grace, whenas death raigneth as yet amongeſt Gods choſen? Nowe, according to the ſaying of S. Paule, ſinne raigneth in deed to death, but grace,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.7.</note> vnto euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb facs="tcp:19502:61"/> life: and therefore if grace ſurmounteth ſinne, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no place for death. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as by Adam death entred, &amp; raigned, euen ſo doth life alſo now raigne by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now then we know, <hi>that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt being rayſed agayne from the dead, dyeth no more: neither hath death any more power ouer him.</hi> For in that he dyed vnto ſinne, he dyed onely once for all: But in that he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, he lyueth vnto God. And hereby we may ſee, that they themſelues refute their error with their owne weapons. For when as they ſay that death is the puniſhment of ſinne, they forthwith graunt, that if man had not ſinned, he had bene Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall. For that which began to be, was not ſometymes: and that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth through puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and not by nature,</p>
            <p>Contrarywiſe S. Paul, that ſinne is ſwallowed vp of Grace, ſo that it hath nothing to doe with the children of God. And ſo we haue gotten this poynt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Gods choſen are now ſuch, as Adam was before he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19502:61"/> ſinned. And as he was created incorruptible, Euen ſo are they now, who are by Ieſus Chriſt, framed a newe into a better na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And that ſaying of the Apoſtle is not agaynſt this:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.54.</note> 
               <hi>That the written word ſhall be accompliſhed: death is ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp into victory.</hi> For if they ſay it is ſo, that the word ſhall be made: then can it not be denyed: but that to be made, muſt alſo be taken to be accompliſhed. For whatſoeuer is now begonne in the ſoule, ſhall be accompliſhed in the body: or rather whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is onely begone in the ſoule ſhal be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed together both in body &amp; ſoule. For, this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death, wherof as by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſitie of nature we all dye, is a naturall way for the elect to come to the ſouereigne degree of Immortalitie,<note place="margin">Auguſtine in his 43. Chap. of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the lyfe of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the lyfe of brute beaſtes.</note> rather then to any euill or puniſhment. And as S. Auguſtine ſayth: <hi>It is nothing els but a finiſhing of the fleſhe, which conſumeth not the thinges that are faſt ioyned and knit together: but maketh a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of them, when as it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth both the one, and the other
<pb facs="tcp:19502:62"/> to their firſt originall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing which they alleadge,<note place="margin">Acts. 7.</note> is that which they ſo often ſpeake of thoſe which are dead,<note place="margin">Iohn. 11.11 2. Theſ. 4.3. Kings 11 21.43.</note> to witt: <hi>That they ſleape.</hi> As it is ſayd of S. Stephen: <hi>That he ſleapt in the Lord.</hi> Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Lazarus, our friend ſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth:</hi> Alſo, <hi>ſorrow not for them that ſleape.</hi> And this ſaying is ſo often repeated in the bookes of the kinges, as that a man ſhall ſcarcely finde any phraſe of the ſcripture more familyar and common. But chiefely &amp; aboue all,<note place="margin">Iob. 14.7.11.</note> they vrge and make a great reckoning of the ſaying in the booke of Iob, where it is ſayd: <hi>There is hope of a tree if it be cut downe, that it will yet ſproute, and the braunches thereof ſpring, but when a man is dead, what is become of him? As the waters paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſea, and as the flood decayeth and dryeth vp, euen ſo a man after he be a ſleape, ryſeth not agayne, neither ſhall he wake out of his ſleape, vntill ſuch tyme as the heauen be not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if we beleue that the ſoules ſleape, becauſe that death is called a ſleape: In the firſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19502:62"/> place, the ſoule of Ieſus Chriſt was poſſeſſed with the very ſame ſleape.<note place="margin">Pſal. 3.5.</note> For Dauid ſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of him ſelfe: <hi>I layd me down and ſleapt, and roſe vp agayne, for the Lord ſuſteyned me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His enemies alſo vſed this wicked ſpeach towardes him:<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.8.</note> 
               <hi>Shall he that ſleapeth, riſe any more agayne?</hi> Wherefore, if it bee not lawfull to thinke ſo baſely, and vily of the ſoule of chriſt (as heretofore hath large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bene handeled) we ought not to ſtand in doubt, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had onely regard vnto the outward ſhape of the bodye, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet hath deryued and fetcht this ſleape from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men. For theſe two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaches, he ſleapt with his fathers, and, he was layd or buried with his Fathers, we take indifferently.</p>
            <p>And yet by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, the ſoule is not layde or buryed by the ſoules of the Fathers. But the body is caryed to be layd in the graue of the Fathers. Samuell lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the ſtory of the Kinges, attributeth this ſleape vnto the Faythleſſe kinges, as may be
<pb facs="tcp:19502:63"/> ſeene in the two laſt bookes of the kings, as alſo in the bookes of the Cronicles. And therefore when thou heareſt it ſayd that a wicked man ſleapeth, thinke thou not once of the ſleape of the ſoule, which can not haue a worſe hangman to torment and vexe it, then an ill and guilty conſcience. what becommeth then of this dreamer or ſleaper, who is thus vexed and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?<note place="margin">Iſyiah. 57. ver. 20.21.</note> 
               <hi>For the wicked are lyke vnto the raging ſea, which can not calme it ſelfe when it luſteth, whoſe flowing ſurges, caſt vp filth and ſtinking badgage: There is no peace</hi> ſayth the Lord, <hi>vnto the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, Dauid mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſet forth the ſharpe pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſting of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience,<note place="margin">Pſal. 13. ver. 3.</note> ſayth: <hi>O Lord my God lighten mine eyes that I ſleape not in death.</hi> Thus we ſee that the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les depth of hell, holdeth wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man beſieged: and the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And therefore theſe ſimple
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19502:63"/> and ignoraunt fondlinges, muſt be ſet agayne to their <hi>A. B.

Neither would I haue any man beleue me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I ſtrſt bring forth certaine places, which playnely ſhew, that ſo often as this ſaying, ſleaping, is taken for death,<note place="margin">Iob. 7.21.</note> it is ſpoken by a figure called <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche.</hi> For, when Iob ſayth: <hi>Behold I ſleape now in the duſt, and if thou ſeekeſt me in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I ſhall haue no more being:</hi> Is it to be thought that his ſoul ſhould be ouercome with ſleape?</p>
            <p>Now therefore, the ſoule is not to be turned into duſt:<note place="margin">Iob. 21. v. 2.6.</note> nei- is it to ſleape in the duſt: As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is ſayd in another place: <hi>They ſhall ſleape both in the duſt and the wormes ſhall couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal 88. ver. 5.</note> And when Dauid ſayth: <hi>Lyke the ſlayne lying in the graue:</hi> Art thou of the opinion that Iob and Dauid (by theſe ſayings) haue put out the ſoules to be eaten of wormes.<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 14. ver. 7.8.</note>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:19502:64"/>

And therefore haue in the olde tyme, called the place which was appoynted to burye the dead, a Churchyard, which ſignifieth aſmuch as a dorture, or a place of ſleape and reſt. Not meaning thereby that the ſoules were there layd, to reaſt them ſelues, but the dead bodies. I truſt now by this tyme, that the ſmokes of theſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19502:64"/> our Gallants are already well vaniſhed, wherein they haue wrapped the ſleapy ſoules, ſince it hath ben proued, that in the whole volume of the ſcripture there cannot be found, that this word, Sleape, ſo often as it is ſet downe for death, is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the ſoules and ſpirites. And beſides, we haue els where more at large handled the reaſt of the ſoules.</p>
            <p>For their fourth obiection, they take great hold of the ſaying of Salamon, as if thereby, they had ſome great matter to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out agaynſt vs: Where it is ſayd in the booke of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, or of the Preacher:<note place="margin">Eccleſi. 3. ver. 18.</note> 
               <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in mine hart vpon the ſtate of the children of men, that God had purged them, yet to ſee to, they are in themſelues lyke vnto beaſtes.</hi> For, the condition of the children of men, and the condition of beaſtes are euen as one condition vnto them: For as the one dyeth, ſo dyeth the other: For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of man aboue the beaſt: For all is vanity. All goe vnto one
<pb facs="tcp:19502:65"/> place, and all was of the duſt, &amp; all ſhall returne to the duſt.</p>
            <p>Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of a man aſcendeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcendeth downeward, and to the earth? What and if Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aunſwered them here in a word? Vanity of Vanities, ſaith the preacher, and all is but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. For, what meaneth he hereby, but to ſhew that the minde of man is vayne, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne of all things? Man ſeeth that he dyeth as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſtes doe, that lyfe and death is with him, as with the beaſtes: and therefore he thus concludeth: that his ſtate and condition, is lyke vnto the ſtate &amp; conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of beaſtes. And lyke as beaſtes haue nothing remayning after death, no more doth man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue any thing vnto him ſelfe after he is dead. And thus we ſee what the ſpirite, the reaſon, and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of man is. For the carnall man perceiueth not the thinges of the ſpirite: For they are to him fooliſhnes, and can neither vnderſtand, nor know them. For a man behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19502:65"/> with his carnall eyes, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth at preſent death: and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth no higher, but conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this after maner: that the earth bringeth forth all things, and ſhall lykewiſe returne to the earth: and in the meane while neuer looketh to the ſoule. And for this cauſe he addeth this ſaying who knoweth whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite of man aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vpward? So that when we come to the ſoule mans reaſon is dryuen to ſuch a ſtraight in it ſelfe, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it wil not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ſure or manifeſt, be it that it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, meditateth, or reaſoneth.</p>
            <p>Seing then it is ſo, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon ſheweth the vanitye of mans minde, becauſe that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſpirite, it is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and wauering, he no way fauoreth their error: but ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſoundely vpholdeth our fayth. For the wiſedome of God layeth wide ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; telleth vs of that which ſurpaſſeth the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and meaſure of mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: to witt:<note place="margin">Gene. 9.</note> 
               <hi>That the ſpirite or minde of the children of men looketh vpward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will alſo propound another
<pb facs="tcp:19502:66"/> lyke thing out of the ſelfe ſame Author, to the end I might ſomewhat bend &amp; plucke downe their ſtiffe neckes. For thus it is ſayd:<note place="margin">Eccleſi. 9. ver. 1.2.3.4.5.</note> 
               <hi>There is no man that knoweth by any outward thing, the loue or hatred of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes men: but all thinges are in an vncertayntie: becauſe that all thinges fall out a lyke vnto all:</hi> The ſelfe and ſame eſtate, is aſwell to the Iuſte as to the wicked, to the good, as to the euill, to the pure, as to the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and to him that ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, as to him that ſacrificeth not.</p>
            <p>And therefore if all thinges be in an vncertaintie, for that which is to come, ſhall then a faythfull man, vnto whome all thinges worke for the beſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, that affliction is a ſigne of the hatred of God? no not ſo. For thus it is ſayd vnto the faythfull, you ſhall be oppreſſed in the world, but in me you ſhall haue conſolation. And they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting vpon this ſaying, doe not onely reaſt themſelues in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant minde vpon whatſoeuer ſhall come vnto them, but doe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19502:66"/> alſo glory in their troubles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing with Iob: That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he would ſlay vs, yet will we put our truſt in him.</p>
            <p>How then are the things that are to come vncertayne? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth ſo farre forth as man can iudge they are ſo. And yet for all that, euery man that liueth is nothing els but vanity. For he goeth on further and ſayth, this is an euill thing amongeſt all the reſt that is done vnder the ſunne, that there is one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition vnto all, and alſo the hartes of the ſonnes of men are full of wickednes, and madnes is in theyr life, and after that, they goe to the deade. There is no man which liueth euer, and hopeth therof: For a liuing dogg is better then a dead Lyon. For the liuing know that they ſhall dye, but the dead know nothing at all: neither haue they any more a reward. For the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of them is cleane for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. And ſpeaketh he not all theſe thinges by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the beaſtlynes of thoſe which looke onely downe at theyr feete, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no hope of the bleſſed life,
<pb facs="tcp:19502:67"/> nor yet of the reſurrection? For although this were in deed true that we are nothing after we be dead, yet notwithſtanding there is a reſurrection, vpon hope whereof, if they did caſt theyr eyes, they would neither be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of God, nor yet filled with wickednes: to the end I might ouerſlippe all the reſt. And therefore let vs conclude with Salamon, that mans reaſon is not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all theſe thinges. So that, if we would haue any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynty thereof. Let vs runne vnto the lawe, and teſtimony, wherein is contayned the truth and wayes of the Lord.</p>
            <p>For ſee what is ſayd in that place,<note place="margin">Eccle, 12.7</note> 
               <hi>vntill ſuch time as the duſt returneth to the earth whereof it was, and the ſpirite returneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God who gaue it.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whoſoeuer hath heard the word of the Lord, needeth not to doubt that the ſpirit of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men aſcendeth vpward. I do here ſimply take to aſcend vpward, is to conſiſt and be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall: as to deſcend downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is to tumble, fall downe,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19502:67"/> and periſh.</p>
            <p>As for their firſt argument, they vomit it out, with open mouth, and ſtrayne forth theyr wide weſauntes, to the end to awake the ſleapers out of theyr deepe and ſound ſleape. For in it they think, ſtandeth the greateſt part of theyr victorye. And at what tyme they meane to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and bleare their young ſchollers eies, this is it that they chiefly lay holde on, whereby to corrupt theyr fayth, and ſounde vnderſtanding. For, ſay they, there is but one iudgement by which euery one ſhall receiue his reward: The good ones, glory and the wicked ones, hell fier. And before this day come, there is neither bleſſedneſſe nor yet miſery apoynted.</p>
            <p>For the ſcripture euery where beareth thereof witnes, for thus it is ſaid:<note place="margin">Mat. 24.31.</note> 
               <hi>And he ſhall ſend his Angels with the great ſound of a Trompet, and they ſhall gather together his elect, from the fower wyndes, and from the one end of the heauens vnto the other.</hi> It is likewiſe ſayd,<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> 
               <hi>The ſonne of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, which
<pb facs="tcp:19502:68"/> ſhall gather all offences out of his kingdome, and they whiche haue wrought iniquity ſhall bee caſt into the fiery furnace, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. And then ſhall the iuſt men ſhine as the ſunne in the kingdom of their Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Math. 25.34.41.46.</note>Alſo it is ſayd, <hi>Then ſhall the king ſay to them that are on hys right hand, come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherite the kingdome prepared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world.</hi> And ſhall ſay vnto them on the left hand, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye curſſed, into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire which is prepared for the Deuill and his Aungels. And theſe ſhall goe into euerlaſting payne, and the righteous into life eternall.</hi> The like ſaying is alſo in Daniell,<note place="margin">Danie. 2.1</note> 
               <hi>And at that time the people ſhalbe ſaued, euery one that ſhall be found written in the Booke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore they ſay, If all theſe thinges are written of the day of iudgement, how can it be that the elect ſhould be called to the inheritaunce of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome, if they already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe it. How ſhall it be ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19502:68"/> them, come hither, whenas they are already there? how ſhal the people be ſaued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as they are preſently ſaued?</p>
            <p>Wherefore, the faythfull which nowe walke faythfully, looke for none other day of their ſaluation: according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. Paule, knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>he who hath rayſed vp Ieſus fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.14</note> 
               <hi>ſhall rayſe vs vp alſo with Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And in an other place it is ſayd, looking for the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>who will make you ſtrong euen vnto the end in the day of his comming. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And admitte we graunted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all this: yet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the way why do they of their owne brayn put to the thing that is not, to wit, ſleape. For they cannot ſhew vs one ſillable of ſleape amongeſt all the places which they alleadge. And although they be awake, yet it may be, that they are with out glory.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, ſeing it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a raſh but alſo a madde mans part, boldely to conclude vpon thinges which man his reaſon is not able to comprehend, of
<pb facs="tcp:19502:69"/> which ſort are theſe ſtraunge &amp; obſtinate opynatiuers, dare they defend ſleape, which they haue not receiued from the mouth of the Lord. And therfore this may ſuffiſe diſcreete and ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the end they might know this ſleape, to be a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les forgery or fayned inuention, as in very deede it is, becauſe it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be proued by the manifeſt word of God.</p>
            <p>Howbeit let vs handle theſe places as briefly as we can, to the end the ſimpler ſort might not be troubled therwith, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they heare it ſayd, that the ſaluation of the ſoules is prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and put of vnto the generall day of iudgement. Firſt of all, we muſt vnderſtand this to be a moſt reſolute and ſure thing, that our bleſſednes is ſtill on the way going vnto this great day, which ſhal end our iourney: In like caſe, the glory of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of theyr laſt hope doth tend and hath an eye vnto the ſame day, becauſe their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes and glory ſhall then be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>For it is agreed hereupon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19502:69"/> emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt all men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is none other perfect bleſſednes, or glory, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely perfect coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God. And vnto this end we all bend, runne, and ſhew our ſelues forward, and all the ſcriptures and promiſes of God ſend vs thereto. For that which God once ſayd vnto Abraham by mouth, belongeth alſo vnto vs: where he ſayth,<note place="margin">Gene. 12.</note> 
               <hi>I am thy verye great reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seing then this reward is appointed for all thoſe that haue part with Abraham, to witte, the enioying of God, and the bleſſed poſſeſſing of him, beſides which reward, it is not lawfull to wiſh any other, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is any queſtion of our hope, wee muſt caſt our eyes vpon it. And thus farre, if I be not deceiued, doe our aduerſaries agree with vs.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, I likewiſe truſt that they will agree with vs in this, that this kingdome, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the choſen and faythfull are called, which in other places is called ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reward, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is none other thing but this moſt bleſſed coniunction and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb facs="tcp:19502:70"/> with God: to wit, for that they are fully in God, and that God maketh them perfect: &amp; that on theyr behalfe, they cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, enioy him fully &amp; wholly and to ſpeake it in one worde, God and they are one. For after this ſort, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as they are in the fountayne of all fulnes, they come euen vnto the laſt end of all righteouſnes, wiſedome, and glory, vpon which bleſſinges the kingdome of God veryly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</p>
            <p>For S. Paule ſheweth it to be the laſt point of the kingdome of God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.28.</note> whenas he ſayth, <hi>To the end that God might be all in all thinges.</hi> And therefore ſeing god in this day, ſhall in very deed be all in all thinges, and bring hys choſen and faythfull to a iuſte perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is not without cauſe that this great day is called the day of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before which tyme our ſaluation is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accompliſhed. For they whome God filleth, are filled with all riches, which no toung ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtter, no eare hath heard, nor eyes haue ſeene, nor yet vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath conceiued. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19502:70"/> ſeing theſe two thinges are out of all queſtion, our ſleapers vaynely take in hand to proue, that the holy ſeruauntes of God who are departed this life, are not as yet entred into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, becauſe it ſhall be ſayd vnto them, come ye bleſſed of my Father inherite &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now this is eaſely aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to be no good conſequence, to ſay, that there is now no king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe as yet it is not perfect. But contrarywiſe, wee ſay, that the kingdome which is already begonne, ſhall then be made perfect. Neither would I haue any man beleue me herein, if I doe not firſt of all manifeſtly ſhew by ſure argumentes of the ſcripture that this is true.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> 
               <hi>For this day, is called the kingdome of God, becauſe that at that time hee ſhall in deed put vnder him, all contrary powers, ſubdue Sathan with the breath of his mouth, and deſtroy him through the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his coming.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>But he himſelfe ſhall fully and wholye dwell and raigne in his choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God cannot hereafter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe raigne in himſelfe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:19502:71"/> he hath raigned from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: whoſe Maieſtie can no way be either encreaſed, or yet diminiſhed: But ſhall raigne in ſuch ſort, as that he ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſhewed vnto all the world. When then we pray to haue his kingdome come, doe we thinke that he hath now no kingdome? And beſides, what ſay they then to this ſaying? the kingdome of God is within you.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, God raigneth at this preſent in his elect, whome he guideth and gouerneth by his holy ſpirite. He reigneth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ouer the Deuill, ſinne, and death, when he commaundeth the light to ſhine in darkenes, by which, error, and lying are confounded: and when as he wil not ſuffer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> powers of darkenes to hurt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who haue the ſigne of the Lambe in their forehead. He reigneth alſo (I ſay) euen at that preſent, when as we pray, and ſay, let thy kingdome come. And ſurely, he lykewiſe raigneth, when as he worketh power in his faythfull, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he geueth a law to Satan, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting him what to doe. But
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19502:71"/> then ſhall his kingdome come, when as it ſhall be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed.</p>
            <p>And then ſhall it be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, whenas he ſhall fully ſhew the glory of his Maieſtie, vnto the faythfull, ſaluation, and vnto the reprobate, ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Howbeit, is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that a man may ſay or beleue of the faythfull &amp; cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen? whoſe kingdome and glory, is to be in the glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: as to raygne as it were with God, and to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him, and finally to be partakers of the diuine glory. And although this kingdome is not yet come, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it may bee ſeene in ſome meaſure.</p>
            <p>For they which haue in ſome meaſure the kingdome of God within them, beginne to be in the kingdome of God, and to raigne with him,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> 
               <hi>agaynſt whom hell gates cannot preuayle.</hi> For they are made righteous in god: as it is ſaid of them,<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 43.</note> 
               <hi>All the ſeed of Iſraell ſhall bee made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vnto the Lord, and be alſo bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, to ſay truely, This
<pb facs="tcp:19502:72"/> kingdome is the building vp of the Church, or the aduauncing of the faythfull, which thing S. Paule deſcribeth vnto vs:<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.13</note> 
               <hi>who by all degrees of ages might grow vp vnto a perfect man.</hi> Now theſe Gallantes ſee here the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this kingdome, and the encreaſes thereof: and ſo ſoone as they ſee theſe thinges with theyr eyes, they geue no longer place vnto fayth, neither can they beleue that which is ſet before their fleſhly eyes.</p>
            <p>But S. Paule telleth them another matter, for thus he ſaith,<note place="margin">Col. 3.3.4.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are all dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God. For when Chriſt who is your life ſhall appeare, ye alſo ſhall appear with him in glory.</hi> He ſayth that <hi>our life is hidd in God with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus who is our head:</hi> Now, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth our glory vnto the day of the glory of Ieſus Chriſt, the head of all the faythfull, &amp; ſhall bring with him his members, as the head of them.</p>
            <p>S. Iohn alſo ſayth the very ſelfe ſame thing. <hi>Dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.2</note> 
               <hi>wee are nowe the ſonnes of God, but yet it doth not appeare
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19502:72"/> what we ſhall be: and we knowe that when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him: For we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Now, he ſayth not by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, that we ſhalbe made nothing for a certayne tyme, but becauſe we are the children of God, who looketh for inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of our Father, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuſtayneth and vpholdeth our hope vnto that day, wherin the maieſty and glory of God ſhall be made manifeſt in vs all, and we for our part, ſhall glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our ſelues in him. Now, they will here agayne maruell, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they heare, the children of God who may not returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto their ſound and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, and feele this generation to bee immortall, which commeth from God, whereby, we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the diuine Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye.</p>
            <p>But let vs goe on with that which we haue begonne. Let them crye out as much as they will, &amp; ſay, that the bleſſed ones of God are not called vnto the kingdome before the great daye of iudgement, and that ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:19502:73"/> is not promiſed vnto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God before that tyme. Yet this I ſay, that Ieſus chriſt is our head, whoſe kingdome &amp; glory haue not yet appeared: But if the members ſhoulde goe before the head, it were a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked kinde of order.</p>
            <p>And therefore, we ſhall nowe follow our Captayne and King, whenas he ſhall come into the glory of his Father, and ſit in the ſeat of his Maieſty. And yet notwithſtanding <hi>that whiche is in vs from God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 16. &amp; 25.</note> 
               <hi>to wit, our ſpirite, liueth: becauſe that Ieſus Chriſte who is our life, is liuing.</hi> For it were an abſurd thing to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our life were liuing, &amp; yet were vtterly periſhed. And this life is in God, and with God: and is alſo bleſſed, becauſe it is in God. All theſe thinges doe very well accord &amp; agree with the trueth. For why is it ſayd of them who are dead in the Lord, that they are not yet deliuered, or that they do not as yet enherite the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God? It is becauſe they lyue in hope of that whych yet they haue not, and haue not as yet attayned vnto the end of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19502:73"/> their felicyty.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then are they not yet bleſſed? It is becauſe they right well knowing that God is merfifull vnto them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a farre of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reward to come, doe reaſt themſelues in the ſure hope of the reſurrection. And ſurely, ſo long as we dwell in this earthly priſon, we hope for the thing which we ſee not: and agaynſt all hope, beleeue in hope: and that is the thing which Saint Paul ſpeaketh, of Abraham: <hi>But,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> 
               <hi>when as the eyes of our vnderſtanding</hi> (who being now buryed in this fleſhe, haue their ſight troubled) <hi>ſhall be no more bleared,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. ver. 27.</note> 
               <hi>we ſhall then ſee the thinges we looke for, and take pleaſure in this hope.</hi> For we are not a feard to ſpeake thus after the maner of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, who ſayth to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary: <hi>That there remaineth none other thing for the reprobate: but a fearefull looking for of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and violent fier, which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure them.</hi> Seing then that the thing which the reprobate looke for is terrible, it is moſt ſure. that the thing which the choſen
<pb facs="tcp:19502:74"/> and faythfull looke for, is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and therefore of very right ought to be called moſt bleſſed.</p>
            <p>And becauſe my meaning is to inſtruct our aduerſaries, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to conſtrayne them, let them geue vs the hearing, when as we ſhall draw the trueth out of a figure of the olde Teſtament, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good warrant.

And S. Auguſtine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo handleth it in another
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19502:77"/> place, when he ſayth: Thy laſt day cannot be farre of: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make thy ſelfe ready for it.</p>
            <p>For as thou paſſeſt out of this life, ſuch one ſhalt thou be found in the life to come. And thou ſhalt not be after this life by and by where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayntes ſhalbe, vnto whom ſhalbe ſayd, come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of my Father, inherite the kingdome which is prepared for you from the foundations of the world. And who knoweth not that thou ſhalt not be there as yet? But thou mayſt very well be there where the rich proud man, being in the middeſt of hys torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſeeth that poore wretch (ſometyme ſtill of fores and blaines) in reſt and peace a great way from him. And thou being taken vp into this reſt, certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lookeſt moſt aſſuredly for thys great day of iudgement, wherein thou ſhalt agayne receiue thy body, and be chaunged and made like vnto the Angels.</p>
            <p>Neither doe I miſlike of that which S. Auguſtine in another place, for Inſtruction ſake, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth withall, ſo he may meete with a ſound and modeſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretor:
<pb facs="tcp:19502:78"/> to wit, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees of the ſoule: The firſt is the quickening of life, or life it ſelfe: The ſecond, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: The third, arte: The fourth, power: The fift, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: The ſixt, entraunce: And the ſeuenth, contemplation. Or if any man had rather ſay thus, The firſt is from the body, The ſecond to the body, The third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, The fourth vnto it ſelfe. The fift in it ſelfe, The ſixt vnto God, The ſeuenth in God.</p>
            <p>I haue not thought it a miſſe to bring in here theſe wordes, to the end to ſhew the meaning of this holy man herein, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrayghtly to binde any, much leſſe my ſelfe to the neceſſity of this diſtinction. For S Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine himſelfe (as I thinke) wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth it not, but meant to ſhew as plainly as he could that there is a going on of the ſoule, which it ſhall neuer fully attayne vnto, vntill the day of iudgement.</p>
            <p>Finally, for this day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which they ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fend themſelues, there is an argument come to my minde, which may plucke this error
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19502:78"/> cleane vp by the rootes. For in our creed, which is the very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all our beliefe, we confeſſe the reſurrection of the fleſh, and not of the ſoule. Neither is there any place left for their wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whenas they will tell vs, that by this word fleſh, is meant the whole man: We graunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it is ſometymes ſo taken, but in this place we flatly denye it them, whereas wordes which are very playne and eaſy to bee vnderſtood are ſet forth vnto the rude and ignoraunt people.</p>
            <p>In very deed the pharyſies who were ſtout defenders and and mayntayners of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and who had alwayes this word, reſurrection in theyr mouthes, did not yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, many tymes beleue that there was a ſoule.</p>
            <p>Yet do they ſtill lay hold on vs and force vs to ſticke vnto this daungerous rock. For they now alleadge the wordes of S. Paul wherein he telleth vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> miſerabler then all men, if the dead did not riſe agayne. And thus they frame their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what needeth ſay they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:19502:79"/> reſurrection, if we be bleſſed before the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? But that which is more, what is that great miſery of chriſtians, which ſurpaſſeth the miſery of all men, if this be true that they are at reſt, whiles the reſidue are ſo greeuouſly tormented, and after ſo wonderfull a manner? And here I geue them warning, that if I meant to dally and ſhift (as they goe about none other thing but to abuſe the ignoraunt people) I would finde ſufficy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent paſſage enough to eſcape. For, who ſhall let me from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of other good men, that haue diſputed, not of the laſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reſurrection, in which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the corruption of our bodies, we ſhall receiue agayne incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible bodyes, but of the lyfe which remayneth for vs after this mortall life, for it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common maner in the ſcripture, to let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by this ſpeach of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, what the bleſſed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life is?</p>
            <p>For when we heare it ſpoken that the Saduces denyed the reſurrection, it is not referred
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19502:79"/> to the body, but is ſimply ſpoken accordyng to theyr opynyon, that after a man be dead, there is no memory left of hym. And hereof is a probable Argument, that whatſoeuer, wherewith S. Paule helpeth himſelfe to ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that, which he hath ſayde, ſhould be ouerthrowen in one word, if it were aunſwered, that it is very true that the ſoules liue, and that the bodyes whiche ſhall turne to duſte, can by no meanes ryſe agayne:</p>
            <p>Let vs now then come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, firſt as touching this ſaying, they which are dead in Ieſus Chriſt are loſt, this might the philoſophers haue eaſely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, who haue mightely and conſtantly defended the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoule. And as for this ſaying, What ſhall they doe who are baptiſed for the dead? It is very eaſely aunſwered: For the ſoules liue after death. And to this which followeth, wherefore are we alſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in danger? It may be au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that we loſe this fraile lyfe, to recouer Immortall lyfe, wherein we ſhall lyue a great
<pb facs="tcp:19502:80"/> deale better. We haue already beſtowed many wordes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the teachable haue had no neede. For, the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth, that we are miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if our hope in Ieſus Chriſt ſtretched it ſelfe no farther then vnto this preſent life. which thing,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. ver. 2.3.</note> euen by the teſtimony of the prophet is out of all doubt, who confeſſeth: <hi>that his feete had almoſt foultred, and his ſteppes had well nye ſlipt, when he ſaw the proſperitie of the proud and wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſay truely, if we looke but downe vnto our feete, we wil ſay thoſe to be bleſſed which haue all thinges come to paſſe as they would wiſhe. But if our eyes looke farther of, we will call them bleſſed, who haue the Lord for their God, in whoſe hand is the iſſue of death. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, we will bring ſome thing which ſhall be a great deale more certaine, by which we will not onely repulſe their obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but alſo declare the true, and natural meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, be glad without ſtryfe of wordes to as many as would
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19502:80"/> meekely, and curtiſly learne.</p>
            <p>For if there be no reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, the faythfull may of very right be called accurſed, yea, were there none other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but this, that they are ſo often vexed, hurt, beaten, and violently handled, and doe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their bodies ſuch extreame wantes, all which they thinke to be appoynted and ordayned for an euerlaſting bleſſednes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are diſapointed of this hope. For, is there any thing, I ſay not, more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but rather more ridiculous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee and beholde the bodies of thoſe, who all the lyue long day, doe nothing els but ſport and laugh, in the fulnes of all delightes, and pleaſures: and contrarywiſe, to ſee the bodies of feebliſhed Chriſtians, dead through hunger and colde, and preſſed with all kindes of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, if the bodies both of the one and the other peariſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke.</p>
            <p>For this thing could I very well confirme by the wordes of the Apoſtle, which he ſetteth downe anone after, when he
<pb facs="tcp:19502:81"/> ſayth, wherefore are we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in daunger? I dayly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death for your glory. &amp;c. Let vs eate and drinke, for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe we ſhall dye. It were a great deale better for vs, ſayth he, that this ſaying ſhould take place in vs, as to ſay: Let vs eate, and drinke, if theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and ſhames, which we ſuffer in our bodies be not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the glory which we hope after. which thing ſhould neuer be, without it were in the reſurrection of the body. Furthermore, although I ſhould paſſe ouer this defence, yet could I bring in another reaſon, that we are more miſerable then all men, if there were not a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>For although we be very bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before the reſurrection: yet is it no bleſſednes without the reſurrection. For we ſay, that for the ſame cauſe the ſpirites of the Saintes and of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are very bleſſed, for ſo much as they reaſt in the hope of the bleſſed reſurrection: and therefore if there were no ſuch thing, all this bleſſednes ſhould
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19502:81"/> turne to nothing. wherefore, the ſaying of the Apoſtle is moſt true, that we are more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then all men, if there be no reſurrection. And this doctrine is not agaynſt theſe wordes, that the ſpirites of the Saintes, are more bleſſed before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but yet it is by reaſon of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They laye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs alſo that percell of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aunci- Fathers, where it is ſayd. <hi>All theſe dyed in fayth, and receiued not the promiſes, but ſawe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a farre of, and beleued them, and receiued them thankefully, and confeſſed that they were ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Pilgrims on the earth.</hi> For they that ſay ſuch thinges, declare playnely that they ſeeke a Countrey.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, if they had bene mindefull of that Countrey, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they came, they were at leaſure to haue returned thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But now they deſier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother much better, which is an heauenly one. And now let vs ſe how theſe our ſleapers frame their iolly Argument.
<pb facs="tcp:19502:82"/> For, ſay they, If they deſier the heauenly Countrey: Then doe they not inherite it. But we frame it after this maner, and ſay, If they deſier it, then haue they a being: for there can be no deſier, without there be ſome to deſier. Now I would draw but this out of them: That where there is a deſier, there muſt alſo be a feeling of good and euill, which deſier muſt either fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the thing that ſeemeth good, or eſchew that which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth euill. Why, ſay they, this deſier reaſteth wholy in God.</p>
            <p>Now tell me I beſeech you, is it poſſible to think or deuiſe a more ridiculous ſaying? And to ſay truely, you ſhall ſee that of theſe two poynts, we ſhall gaine vnto our ſelues one of them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God deſiereth ſome better thing then he hath, or els that there is ſomething in God which is not of God. And this maketh me thinke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launtes doe burieſt at an earneſt and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ghtie matter.</p>
            <p>But now let vs leaue to ſpeake of all this geare, and ſee, what the tyme, or ſpace of returning,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19502:82"/> meaneth? let them therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with a good minde, and heare a better thing then this fantaſticall opinion, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they haue held.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and of his poſteritye, who dwelt out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey emongeſt ſtraungers, And they differed not greatly, as it were from baniſhed men, or els as Seaiournes, becauſe they had ſcarſely any Tents, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines to couer them withall, following the commaundement which the Lord g&amp;ue vnto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, which was this, That he ſhould leaue his parentes and kinſefolkes, and get him out of the land.</p>
            <p>For God had promiſed them a thing which as yet he had not manifeſted and performed. And ſo they ſawe the promiſes a farr of, and dyed in a ſure fayth, that it would one day come to paſſe, that God would fulfill his promiſes. By which fayth they confeſſed that they had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ſure abiding or dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place on earth, but that they had a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey which was
<pb facs="tcp:19502:83"/> not on the earth, and which they wiſhed for, to witt, heauen. And in the latter end of the chapiter he ſheweth that all they whome he there ſpake of, receiued not the laſt promiſe to the end they might not come to perfection without vs.</p>
            <p>And ſo if theſe our ſleapers had obſerued the proprietie of this ſaying, they had neuer ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp ſo many troubles. Now it is a wonder to ſee how blinde they are in ſo great light. But yet this is a more ſtrange thing, that they geue vs bread in ſtead of ſtones: to witt, whiles they goe about to ouerthrow the cauſe, they mainteine and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it.</p>
            <p>Now, for the matter which is ſpoken of <hi>Thabita</hi> in the Acts of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Acts. 9.40</note> they thinke they haue, by it, a ſuer piller to leane vnto. For ſhe, being a ſcholler of Ieſus Chriſt, full of good workes and a good Almes wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was rayſed agayne by S. Peter. And therefore ſay they, <hi>Thabita</hi> had great wrong, If it be true that we ſay. That the ſoules which are ſeperated
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19502:83"/> from the bodies, doe lyue in God and with God: becauſe ſhe was taken away from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God, and from that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed lyfe, to returne into this ſea of wickednes. As though we could not returne the ſelfe and ſame thing agayne vpon their owne hedds. For be it, that ſhe ſleapt, or that ſhe was nothing, yet was ſhe bleſſed, becauſe ſhe dyed in the Lord.</p>
            <p>And therefore it was not expedient that ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne in that lyfe which ſhe had finiſhed. They them ſelues haue ſnarled this knot, and therefore let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt of all looſe it agayne if they pleaſe. For it is good reaſon, that they ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to that law, which they make for others. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we will eaſely enough vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe it. For, the ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is prepared for vs after death, which S. Paule ſpeaketh of himſelfe, is put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to all the faythfull, to witt,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.21</note> 
               <hi>that in death is aduauntage, and that the beſt being is with Chriſt.</hi> And yet Saint Paule ſayth of <hi>Epaphodite</hi> (who without
<pb facs="tcp:19502:84"/> doubt was one of the number of the faythfull) <hi>That God hath pitie of him, becauſe he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him from a great ſicknes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.27.</note> 
               <hi>and reſtored him to his health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe Gallauntes who deale with the miſteries of God ſo vndiſcretely, and ſo vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, might ſay that this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and compaſſion, was cruell dealing. But we ſay, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, to be mercy: becauſe the mercy of God hath certein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: For this it is ſayd: <hi>Thoſe whome he hath choſen, he hath ſanctified:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>and whome he hath ſanctified, them hath he alſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi> Doth not the Lord then exerciſe his mercy, when as he more and more ſanctifieth vs? Let vs then ſay thus much, If it be the good will of God (as S. Paule ſayth to haue Chriſt to be magnified in our bodies by lyfe, is not this mercy? what, is it for vs to appoynt God a law to worke miracles?</p>
            <p>And it is ſufficient, that the glory of the Aucthor ſhineth in them, for what matter were it, if we ſay that God, in the doing hereof regarded not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19502:84"/> of <hi>Thabita,</hi> but the poore who wept, and ſhewed the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which ſhe had made for them, at whoſe prayers ſhe was rayſed vp agayne? For S. Paul thinketh this to be a reaſon good enough for him, that he lyued, although it had bene better for him in deed to haue gone to the Lord. And after he had ſayd that God had had compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Epaphrodite,</hi> he addeth and not onely of him, but vpon me alſo: to the end I ſhould not be out of meaſure ſorrowfull. Now goe your wayes, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with God, becauſe he hath agayne deliuered vnto the poore a carefull woman, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing of their neceſſitie. For although we ſee not the reaſon of this deede, yet hath Ieſus Chriſt very well deſerued, to be glorified, both by our lyfe, and by our death: <hi>Seeing that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and role agayne, that he might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

For when Iobe ſpeaketh of man, he ſayth: That he ſhooteth forth, &amp; bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſommeth as a flower, and is cut downe: he vaniſheth alſo as a ſhadow, and continueth not, and what other meaning hath he by this diſcription, but that man is frayle and tranſitory, &amp; lyke vnto a withering flower. And Iſaiah alſo is appointed to cry out and ſaye:<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 40 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>That all fleſhe is graſſe, and all the graſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is as the flowers of the fielde: The graſſe withereth, and the flower fadeth: But the word of the Lord endureth for euer.</hi>

            <p>Go to now, Let theſe men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a word, that the ſoule

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The lyke ſaying alſo is in another pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.13.</note> for it is ſayd: <hi>That as a louing Father hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in his children ſo hath the Lord compaſſion on all thoſe that feare him. For he knoweth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we men are made: and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe remembreth that we are but duſt. The dayes of man are as graſſe, as a flower of the fielde ſo floriſheth he:</hi> For the winde go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ouer it, and it is gone, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place thereof ſhall know it no more. Now, if they will by theſe wordes affirme, that the ſpirite peariſheth and becommeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I tell them agayne, let them beware they lay not open a place for the Epicures, if any of them ſhall ariſe to corrupt the beliefe which both they, and we haue of the reſurrection: For there is too too great a number of ſuch ſcoffers. For by the ſelfe ſame reaſon, they will frame this Argument, That the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite returneth no more into the body, ſeing it is ſayd, that it ſhall not know the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of any more. But they will ſay, That they make hereon a falſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19502:88"/> collection: becauſe the places of the reſurrection are very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt agaynſt this manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. Yea and they themſelues make an ill collection, whoſe Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaying in the booke called Eccleſiaſticus, is almoſt lyke, for there it is ſayd: The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a mans dayes for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more part is an hundreth yeares: and no man hath certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his death. As droppes of rayne are vnto the ſea: and as a grauell ſtone is in compariſon of the ſand: ſo are a thouſand yeares, to the day euerlaſting. Therefore is the Lord louing and patient with men, &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out his mercy vpon them. And therefore they muſt needs confeſſe, that the Proyhet had another meaning then that which they dreame of: That God of his goodnes, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of thoſe, whome he hath allowed to be his, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through his mercy: and that if he pull back his hand neuer ſo little from them, they returne into duſt, from whence they were taken. And a little after
<pb facs="tcp:19502:89"/> he maketh a ſhort diſcription of the lyfe of man, comparing it vnto a flower, which ſpringing to day, is no better then graſſe the next morning. So, that if it were to be ſayd, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of man peariſheth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to nought, yet were not their error any whit ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby. For when we ſay that the ſpirite of man is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, we doe not affirme that it is able to ſtand and abide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the hand of God, or to continue faſt and ſure without his power. Now, God lyketh not, nor is not pleaſed that we ſhould thus blaſpheme. But we ſay, that the ſpirite is vpholden by the hand and bleſſing of God. And ſo defendeth Ireneus alſo the Immortalitie of the ſoule with vs:<note place="margin">Ireneus in his 3. boke agaynſt Marcian.</note> and yet would he haue vs vnderſtand: <hi>That by nature we are mortall, and that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is Immortall.</hi> And he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it after this fort: To the end we might not be puffed vp with vayne glory, as if we had lyfe as it were of our ſelues, neither yet proudly lift vp our ſelues agaynſt God: But that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19502:89"/> we might learne by experience, That it proceedeth from his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightines, and not from our nature, that we haue a firme and euerlaſting perſeueraunce. And thus ye ſee what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie is, which we haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt Dauid, whome they make ſo mighty an Aduerſary agaynſt vs. Now he ſayth, that if the Lord take his mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from man, that then he commeth to nought and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth.</p>
            <p>And we for our part doe teach, that he is firme, and ſure and vpholden by the louing kindnes and power of God: and the reaſon is this: <hi>That God is alone Immortall:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note>

               <hi>and my lyfe draweth neare to the graue.

<pb facs="tcp:19502:90"/> they: If they haue bene cut of by the power of God, and fallen away from his prouidence, and from out of his remembraunce, doe they not then ceaſe to be? As if I could not returne them this Argument into their owne lappes and boſomes. What and if they be cut of by the power of God: and that there is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of them, how is it poſſible for them to be againe? and beſides, what ſhall become of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 112.6</note> By this we ſee that they are not fallen away from the hand of God, neither hath he forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.

It is alſo partely meant, That his name is not gloryfied after we are dead: For then he ſheweth not his benefites vnto men, as he ſheweth them whiles they are vpon the earth.

            <p>And heere in the firſt place, we are to learne this: to witt, that though it be ſo, that by death, is very often, and as it were alwayes meant, the ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this lyfe, and by this word hell, the graue, yet ſhall we many tymes finde in the ſcripture, that theſe wordes are taken for the wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God: ſo that it is ſayd of them, from whome God eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelfe, and whome he throweth downe by his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and bruſeth by his hand, that they goe downe into hell, or dwell in hell. For, to ſpeake properly, hell ſignifieth not the pit or graue,<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 5.14</note> but deſtruction or confuſion: as in this place. <hi>Hell hath enlarged it ſelfe, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp many.</hi>

            <p>It is alſo ſayd in another place:<note place="margin">Math. 11.25.</note> 
               <hi>And thou Capernaum which art lifted vp into heauen: I tell thee truely, thou ſhalt be brought downe into hell.</hi> And although this figuratiue ſpeach be found throughout all the holy ſcriptures, yet is it moſt chiefly vſed in the pſalmes, as in this.

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 143.3.</note> 
               <hi>he hath layd me in the darknes, as they that haue bene dead, long agoe.</hi> It is alſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in S.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19502:92"/> as the ſtate of thoſe, whome God hath condemned, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to baniſhment.</p>
            <p>And that is the confeſſion which we make in our Creede, That Ieſus Chriſt deſcended into hell: that is to ſay: That his Father plunged him into all the ſorrowes of death for our ſakes, that he ſuffred all the tormentes of death, and all the afflictions, terrors, and feares thereof, and was in very deede afflicted: although it is ſayd before that he was buried. Contrarywiſe, they that feele the mercy and louing kindenes of the Lord, are ſayd,<note place="margin">Pſal. 133.3</note> 
               <hi>That they lyue, and ſhall lyue.</hi> For there the Lord appoynted the lyfe and bleſſing for euer.<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.19</note> Lykewiſe: <hi>To the end he might deliuer their ſoules from death, and to preſerue them in famine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 52.5</note> Alſo, <hi>God ſhall plucke thee out of the tabernacle, and roote thee out of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the liuing</hi> Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:<note place="margin">Pſal. 56.13.</note>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.</note> Alſo, <hi>I will geue thankes vnto the Lord, in the land of the liuing.</hi> But now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may make an
<pb facs="tcp:19502:93"/> end, let vs content our ſelues with one teſtimony, which ſo naturally deſcribeth both the one, and the other, as that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſhould ſay neuer a word, yet layeth it forth our meaning very notably. The wordes are theſe:<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.6 7.9.10.14</note> 
               <hi>Who truſt in their Goods, and boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the multitude of their riches.</hi> Yet a man can by no meanes redeeme his brother: he cannot geue his raunſome to God: although he take neuer ſo great paynes, and liue neuer ſo long. Shall not he ſee the pitt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he ſeeth the wiſe do dy? The fooliſhe and ignoraunt ſhal both peariſh. They are layd into the graue lyke ſheepe: and death deuoureth them. And the righteous ſhall haue dominion ouer them in the morning: their Glory alſo ſhall conſume, and the graue ſhall be their houſe. But God ſhall deliuer my ſoule from the power of the graue, when he hath receiued me. The ſomme and effect hereof is this. That they which put their truſt in riches and in the ſtrength of them, in the end doe by, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19502:93"/> into the graue: For the rich and the poore, the foole and the wiſe, doe all peariſh. But he which truſteth in the Lord, ſhall be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of hell.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay and defend it, that theſe wordes death and hell which they haue layd before vs in the verſes of the pſalmes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd, and in the ſong of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah,</hi> can no otherwiſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And I further ſay and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that this may very well be proued by certaine and ſure Argumentes. For be it that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, who is the head of all the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and be it that the Church, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaketh in theſe verſes, wilt thou ſhewe miracles vnto the dead. &amp;c. And lykewiſe, what profite is in my bloud. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That death is to be abhorred, as a deteſtable &amp; feareful thing: &amp; ſhe fleeth it as much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and prayeth that it might not be layd vpon her. Which thing alſo <hi>Ezechiah</hi> deſiereth in his ſong. Wherefore then feare they to heare onely the name of
<pb facs="tcp:19502:94"/> death, if they are thus certayne, that God is mercifull and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnto them? Is it becauſe they ſhould be no more any thing But they would eſkape out of this world that is full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, full of greuous temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of all diſquietnes, to come vnto a ſoueraigne and bleſſed reaſt. And becauſe they ſhould be no more any thing, they ſhould feele no more any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, which is neither prolonged by their death, nor yet ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by their lyfe. Let vs now turne our ſelues and looke vpon the examples of the reſt of the Saintes, and ſee if the lyke matter hath fallen ſo out vnto them. Firſt, when Noah dyed, he bewayled not his eſtate.<note place="margin">Gene. 49.</note> 
               <hi>Nei- did Abraham once make any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> Iacob alſo reioyced amidſt his laſt ſithes, in that he looked for the ſauing health of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. Iob, wept not. Moyſes hearing his laſt houre to be at hand, was no whit troubled. And for any thing that may be ſeene, they all embraſed death very coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, and willingly. we alſo very ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare theſe aunſweres
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19502:94"/> of the faythfull, when the Lord called them: Loe, here I am Lord. And therefore it cannot be choſen, but that there was ſome other thing, which enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Ieſus Chriſt and his fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make ſuch complayntes. Neither muſt me ſtand in doubt that when Ieſus Chriſt offred himſelfe, to ſuffer puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for vs, but that he fought agaynſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of the Deuill, agaynſt all the tormentes of hell, and the ſorrowes of death: all which thinges ſhould haue bene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in our fleſhe, that they might haue loſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> right, which they had in vs.</p>
            <p>Seing then it is ſo, that in this conflict he ſatiſfied the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and ſeueritie of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, and fought agaynſt hell, death, and the Deuill, he beſought his Father that he would not forſake him in the middeſt of ſo great diſtreſſes, nor deliuer him into the power of death, crauing none other thing at his Fathers hand, but that our weakenes, which he bare in his body, might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the power of the
<pb facs="tcp:19502:95"/> Deuill, and death. And this is the fayth, whereupon we muſt now ſtay our ſelues. that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſinne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in our fleſhe, which was to be payd in the ſelfe ſame fleſhe, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffying of the righteouſnes of God, hath bene diſcharged and payd in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſt which was ours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt neuer fledd the death but this horrible feeling of the ſeueritie of God, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he ſhould be chaſtiſed with death, for the ſauing of vs. Wilt thou know from what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and minde this voyce came? I know not which way better to expreſſe it, but euen by another ſpeach comming from himſelfe, when as he ſayd, <hi>My God my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> He calleth then theſe dead, and buryed, and thoſe that were carryed into the land of forgetfulnes, the forſaken peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. After this manner, the ſaints who were taught by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite of God, vſed not theſe ſpeaches, to dryue death away, &amp; to thruſt God back that called them: but to the end they might

               </gap> death of it ſelfe is euill, becauſe it is the curſe and puniſhment for ſinne: For on the one ſide, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19502:96"/> know in the middeſt of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes thereof, that God is fauorable, and a mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hath Chriſt for his guide and companion. Now, as many as are not thus ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, death is to them confuſion, and euerlaſting deſtruction. Wherefore it is impoſſible for them to prayſe God in death.</p>
            <p>And as for this verſe: The dead prayſe thee not. &amp;c. Is a concluſion of the prayſes of the people, geuing thankes vnto God, becauſe he defended them from daunger by his mighty power. This is then the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, If the Lord had ſuffered vs to be ouercome, and that we had fallen vnder the power of ouer enemies: They would then haue lifted themſelues vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt his Maieſtie, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in them ſelues, that they had ouercome the God of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell. But now, after the Lord had ſuppreſſed and abated their pride, and after that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vs from the cruelty of our enemies, through a mighty hand and an outſtretched arme, the Gentiles could not ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:19502:97"/> where is now their God? who ſhewed himſelfe in very deede to be the liuing God. Neither can his mercy come euer in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he ſo notably hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. And here, they whome God hath forſaken, and whoſe power and louing kindenes, they haue not felt, are called dead. As if he had forſaken his people through the crueltie and vnmercifulnes of the wicked. This ſaying is fully confirmed by the prayer that is ſet downe in the booke of the prophet Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruck. There it is ſayd: <hi>O Lord open thine eyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Baruck. 2.17.18.</note> 
               <hi>and behold, for the dead that are in the graues, and whoſe ſoules are out of their bodies, geue vnto the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayſe, nor righteouſnes: But the ſoule that is vexed with the greatnes of ſinne, and he that goeth crookedly, and weake, and the eyes that fayle, and the hongry ſoule, wil geue thee praiſe and righteouſnes, O Lord.</hi> In this place without doubt, a man may very well ſee, that vnder the name of the dead, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all theſe, which are afflicted and throwne downe by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19502:97"/> the hand of God, and fallen into deſtruction: and that a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, rent, and torne ſoule is ſuch a one, as being voyde of her owne power, and not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelfe vpon her owne confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, runneth vnto the Lord, calleth vpon him, and looketh for helpe at his handes. If any man would take all theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,, as it were by the diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of a perſon, he may ſoone haue an eaſy order to come to the manifeſt laying of them ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe that in perſons the deed is taken: and when we heare this ſaying of the dead, in this ſence, is meant, death. For the Lord winneth no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his mercy, &amp; goodnes, when as he afflicteth, puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, and deſtroyeth, (although the puniſhmentes be iuſt.) But euen then createth he a people vnto himſelfe, to ſing and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the prayſe of his goodnes, when he deliuereth thoſe who are afflicted, caſt downe, and fallen into deſpayre, and lifteth them agayne into hope. But becauſe theſe ſleapers might not wrangle and ſay, that we runne
<pb facs="tcp:19502:98"/> into crooked figures, I au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere that theſe thinges may alſo be taken without any figure.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, I haue ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there might be a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and falſe concluſion of theſe places, that the ſayntes after they are dead are no body, and doe no longer prayſe the Lord. But I ſay agayne, that they rather prayſe him, which is, they tell fourth, and declare the benefites of God vnto others, who doe prayſe him. And theſe wordes doe not onely beare this ſence, but doe alſo requier it. For to declare and tell fourth, and that the father geueth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren knowledge, is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the glory of God in ſpirite and vnderſtanding, but to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him with the mouth, to the end that others might heare. But if they would here diſturbe me of my purpoſe and talke, and ſay that it is lawfull for them to doe the ſame, if they be in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with God (as we beleue) to this I aunſwere, that to be in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and to lyue with God, is not to talke one with another, and one to heare another, but onely to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19502:98"/> take pleaſure in God, to feele his good will, and to reaſt in him. And therefore if they haue any other reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s els where let them looke well vnto them. For, as for my ſelfe, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer goe about to ſeeke after ſuch crooked queſtions, which ſerue more to ſtyrre vp debate and ſtrife, then to ſet fourth Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the feare of God.</p>
            <p>Neither doth that ſaying which is written in the booke of Eccleſiaſticus te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to this end: That the ſoules of the dead doe peariſh: But when he exhorteth that we, in good time, and as occaſion ſerueth, might geue thankes vnto God, he ſoone after teacheth, that after death, there is no more tyme to prayſe him: That is to ſay, that there is no place left for repentaunce. Now, if there be any emongeſt them that doe yet murmure and are not contented, ſaying, this toucheth vs nothing at all, that deſtruction it ſelfe muſt come vnto children: I aunſwere for the faythfull,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.17. Pſal. 84 4.</note> 
               <hi>that they ſhall not dye, but lyue, and ſhall ſet fourth the workes of the Lord. They

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 146.2.</note> 
               <hi>will prayſe him for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixte place which they alledge out of the pſalmes is this: <hi>I will prayſe the Lord du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my lyfe, and as long as I haue any being, I will ſing pſalmes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my God.</hi> And thus they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: If a man muſt prayſe the Lord ſo long as he lyueth, and hath any being, he will not prayſe him after death, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath no being. And becauſe, as I thinke, that they ſpeake this meryly and in the way of ieſting, euen ſo will I alſo for their ſakes ſpeake ſome thing by the way of myrth.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Eneas,</hi> as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Virgile, promiſed vnto his hoſteſſe to acknowledge that humanitie, and curteſy which he had receiued at her handes, as long as he thought of her, meant he hereby, that he would ſometymes forget her: when as he ſayd, So long as my ſoule ſhall ſtyrre in my body: did he thinke by this, that he would acknowledge the good turne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, in theſe fabulous fieldes.</p>

            <p>All this geare ſerueth them to no purpoſe.

            <p>For if in this caſe, there is no man that hath his being, but he that is, they that are not in him haue no true being, becauſe they are for euer confounded, and caſt out from before his face.

            <p>Let vs now come to that which remaineth out of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Iob.<note place="margin">Iob. 3.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.</note> For we haue herebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore handled ſomething, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſame matter as it came in queſtion. The firſt is, <hi>Why dyed I not in the byrth? or why dyed I not ſo ſoone as I came out of my mothers wombe? why did the knees preuent me: and why did I ſucke the breaſtes? For ſo ſhould I now haue lyen and bene quiet, I ſhould haue ſleapt then and bene at reaſt, with the kinges and Counſellers of the earth, which haue builded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues deſolate places: or with the Princes that had Gold, and haue filled their houſes with ſiluer, or why was I not hid as an vntimely byrth, or as Infants which haue not ſeene the light?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wicked haue there cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their tyranny, and there, they that labored valiauntly, are at reaſt.

            </p>
            <p>For I haue as good a coulor by that place to reaſon, that the dead haue wit and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as they haue to gather by the wordes of Iobe, that the dead haue vtterly loſt their whole vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>But I leaue vnto them thoſe tryfling and toyiſh inuentions. Now it will be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to make playne the place which they alledge, without we would deuiſe mazes of our owne mindes. For Iob being preſſed with maruelous afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and almoſt fainting vnder that burden, had none other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, but vnto his preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries: and did not onely thinke them to be the greateſt that mought be, but thought alſo that there could not well be any moe ſuch.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:19502:102"/>
            <p>He no whit feared death, but deſiered it, becauſe it bringeth with it a common condition vnto all: maketh an end of the rule of kinges, &amp; of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſeruauntes: and laſtly, it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of all thinges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto euery man reſigneth the eſtate which he had in this world. For, by this meane he truſteth to ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And yet by the way, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not what manner of lyfe it was that they there leadd, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet what he ſhould doe, or yet ſuffer, But onely deſiered moſt earneſtly the chaunge of the preſent ſtate: as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are wonted to doe, that are tormented with the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment feeling of ſorrow. For if when we feele the great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame heates of Sommer, we iudge winter to be temperate and milde: and contrarywiſe, when we are nipped, and pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſharpe and cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we altogether wiſhe for Sommer: what ſhall he doe in reſpect, who feeleth the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God agaynſt him?</p>
            <p>And therefore let vs not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19502:102"/> although this be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to perſwade our galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For they gather together frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and curtalled ſentences for their defence, and neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the ſomme and effect of the whole matter.

            <p>The ſecond is this:<note place="margin">Iob. 7.7.8.9.</note> 
               <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that my lyfe is but a winde, and that mine eye ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to ſee pleaſure.

                  </gap> he that goeth downe to the graue, ſhall come vp no more.</hi> By theſe words Iob bewayleth his miſery before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſence of God, and enlargeth it, as one who had no hope before his eyes to ſee the iſſue of his griefe.</p>
            <p>For his griefes were before him, which perſued him euen to his graue. And therfore it came in his minde, that after his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable lyfe, he could looke for none other, but for as miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a death. For whoſoeuer fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="tcp:19502:103"/> the hand of God agaynſt him, can not otherwiſe thinke.</p>
            <p>So that in amplyfying his griefe, it moueth compaſſion, and maketh him ſelfe miſerable before God. Now I ſee not what other thing is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in this place beſides this, except it be that there is no reſurrection to be looked for. Which thing at this tyme I minde not to diſcuſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 16.17</note>The thyrd is this, <hi>The graue ſhall be my houſe:</hi> Alſo, <hi>All my thinges ſhall goe downe into the bottome of the pitt.</hi> All this is true. For there remaineth none other thing for him whome God fauoureth not (as Iob then thought of himſelfe) but the graue, the deepe pit, and death. And therefore, after he had long diſcourſed of all his miſeries, he ſayth that the end of them is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
            <p>And this is the end and iſſue of all thoſe whome God ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with his hand. For in his wrath, is death, and in his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindenes and mercy,<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſt. 37.24.</note> is lyfe. The booke of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus hath very wel declared this,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19502:103"/> whenas it is ſayd: <hi>The lyfe of man ſtandeth in the number of dayes: but the dayes of Iſraell are innumerable.</hi> But becauſe this Aucthor is of no ſound auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, we will heare leaue him, and heare the prophet teaching this very notably, ſaying:<note place="margin">Pſal. 102.23.24.25.26.27.28.</note> 
               <hi>He abated my ſtrength in the way, and ſhortned my dayes: And I ſayd, O my God, take me not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the middeſt of my dayes: thy yeares enduer from generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to generation. Thou haſt a foretyme layd the foundations of the earth, and the heauens are the worke of thy handes. They ſhall peariſhe but thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duer: euen they all ſhall waxe olde lyke a garment: as a veſture ſhalt thou chaunge them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto hath he declared, how frayle and brittle our ſtate is: although in deede, nothing vnder heauen is ſtedfaſt and ſuer: ſeing they all corrupt and come to naught. And anon after it followeth: But thou art the ſame, and thy yeares ſhall not fayle. The children of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes ſhall continue, and their ſeede ſhall ſtand faſt in thy
<pb facs="tcp:19502:104"/> ſight. Herein we may very well ſee, how he ioyneth the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faythfull with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie of God.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſo often as they ſet before vs Iob as afflicted by the hand of God, and almoſt fallen into deſpayre, they ſpeake nothing of hell and death: and I tell them that when God is angry, we can looke for none other iſſue: and that it commeth of his free mercy, when we are taken out of deathes chapps.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 34.14.15.</note>The fourth is this: <hi>If he ſet his hart vpon man, and gather vnto him ſelfe his ſpirite and his breath, all fleſhe ſhall peariſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and man ſhall returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to duſt.</hi> If they take theſe words for iudgement, as if it were ſayd, that by the wrath of God, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is caſt downe, ouerthrowne, confounded and vtterly brought to naught, I will graunt them more then they demaund. Or els if they meane that the ſpirite, to wit, the ſoule, returneth to God, after death: and that the breath, to wit, the mouing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or liuely motion departeth from man, I will not gayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19502:104"/> it. But if their controuerſie be, that the ſoule peariſheth, I am tooth and nayle agaynſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Although in the Hebrew it is ſomewhat otherwiſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented that I haue put by, their wranglings, I will heare leaue.</p>
            <p>They caſt alſo other dartes, but they are blunt and hurt not, &amp; therefore are not to be greatly feared. For they alledge certayn places, which ſerue to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, &amp; out of ſuch bookes whoſe Aucthoritie is vncertaine: As out of the fourth booke of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras, and out of the ſecond booke of the Macabies. And yet for all this, we will none otherwiſe au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere, but as we haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſpoken of the reſurrection. Although that in all theſe things they openly ſhew their impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſhameleſnes, ſeing they are ſo bould as to take Eſdras for them ſelues, who maketh altogether on our ſide.</p>
            <p>Neither are they aſhamed to bring fourth the bookes of the Machabies for the defence of their cauſe: Where Ieremy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death prayed the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:19502:105"/> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people that fought: where prayers are appoynted for the dead, to the end that by them, their ſinnes might be forgeuen.</p>
            <p>It may be, that they haue other Arguments, but as yet I know them not: For in very deede, I haue not altogether ſeene all their gloſes and drowſy dreames. And, for any thing I know, I haue leaft out nothing, which may cauſe the vnlearne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſort, to chaunge or wauer. But I agayne deſier all thoſe which ſhall reade this, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Anabaptiſts (whome it is enough that I haue ſo named, for the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all kindes of horrible wickednes) are the Aucthors of this iolly doctrine.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe (ſayth he) I verely think, that the parties aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named haue ſufficiently ſayd, that that man doth not the duety of a Chriſtian, who in all the dayes of his lyfe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not a confeſſion of his fayth: Much leſſe then, he who defileth himſelfe with diſſimuling of Idolatry: therefore will I ceaſe to diſpute thereof at large. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, This is my opinion and aunſwere to the Queſtions following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether a godly and deuoute man, may rather forſake his Countrey, and leaue his calling, then to be preſent at Maſſes, at the celebration of the burialls of the dead, after the popiſhe manner, and vſurpe ſuch ceremonies of Popery, as are agaynſt the word of God.</p>
            <p>I aunſwere, that not onely the ſpirituall Worſhipp of God, but alſo the outward profeſſion of him, wherein is conteyned the glory of his Maieſtie, are to be preferred
<pb facs="tcp:19502:106"/> before Countrey and kinſefolkes, yea before lyfe it ſelfe. And therefore, whoſoeuer they be which lyue in ſuch places, as that they cannot performe that duety vnto God which is neceſſarily required of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, let them vnderſtand thus much, that this commaundement ſtretcheth it ſelfe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well vnto them, as vnto Abraham, where it is ſayd in Gene. 12.1. Get the out of thy Countrey, &amp; from emongeſt thy kinred, except peraduenture they haue this cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious minde with them, that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye whenſoeuer they ſhall be driuen thereto, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forſake their profeſſion, for any fauour or gayne whatſoeuer, which they may any way obtaine at the handes of men,</p>
            <p>Here is alſo another obiection, that no lawfull vocation or calling appointed by God, is for any cauſe vnaduiſedly to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: and therefore in no wiſe to be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily leaft.</p>
            <p>I aunſwere, that euery Chriſtian is bound vnto his calling, euen to the vttermoſt of his power. Wherefore, except God would render vp his owne title and intereſt, there is nothing that ought, or may hold vs from doing our duety. For either God is to be reſpected in the calling, or els we haue ſome other end and purpoſe. And therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out we make the chiefeſt accompt of the glory of God, this name or title of calling, is but vainely foiſted in. Howbeit if this
<pb facs="tcp:19502:106"/> obtayne the principall place, as it is good reaſon it ſhould, we are to call to minde that we are ſo farfourth bound to our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as that it ought by no meane to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw vs from the true and ſincere worſhipp of God. To be ſhort, lyke as the firſt table of the law taketh place before the ſecond, Euen ſo lykewiſe are all the dueties of the ſecond Table to be directed vnto it, as to a true and perfect ſquare. For, this is the ſomme and effect of the firſt Table, to hold and keepe the pure worſhipp, adoration, &amp; inuocation of our God.</p>
            <p>This therefore is my opinion, That there is nothing in all the world of ſo great a price whatſoeuer, which ought to cauſe any Chriſtian to prophane himſelfe with any dregges of ſuperſtition, thereby to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhe or violate the worſhipp of God. For if he doe, it is impoſſible for him to be excuſed.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, when as I in this ſort ſhall ſet downe, that popiſhe Maſſes, and dyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and all ſolemne prayers, wherein the dead Saintes are called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are of this kinde: he that ſhall heare me, will neuer agree to heare Maſſe, or yet be preſent at any ſuch filthy traſhe, neither yet once flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as if he might doe it.</p>
            <p>But what if ſome man, by fine, and cleanly diſſembling, for the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>weales ſake, and the benefite of many, were able
<pb facs="tcp:19502:107"/> to redeeme great riches and commodities?</p>
            <p>I aunſwere, that none of all theſe thing are able once to counteruaile the true and neceſſary profeſſion of the worſhip of God and the teſtimony of Religion. And beſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is not for vs to make a reckoning of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to follow that which the Lord preſcribeth vnto vs.</p>
            <p>For it belongeth to God alone to gouerne the euentes. Laſtly, it is not for vs to alte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that which he hath ſet downe, by any cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunces, but we are to keepe our ſelues vnſpotted and blameles towardes his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, both in ſoule and body.</p>
            <p>But what if a greuous and hurtefull offence ſhould ariſe through the departure of ſome, ſo that the cruelty of the vngodly might be prouoked, and occaſion of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlyding be geuen to the weake?</p>
            <p>I aunſwere, that this is a thing vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto vs: For God may ſo moderate the matter, as that all thinges may turne to the contrary. And ſurely, there is not ſo much hurt to be feared thereof, as hope of much good. For, how furiouſly ſoeuer the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are blinded, it will be a notable hoate yron to wound their conſciences, to ſee, that they which doe depart, had rather forſake their Countrey, kinſfolkes, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer els that men greatlyeſt delight in, then to defile themſelues with Idolatry.
